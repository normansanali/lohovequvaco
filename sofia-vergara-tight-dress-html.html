We are thankful that she has participated in the event, considering the collection of pictures that she has posted. Vergara is shown in a very tight and form-fitting dress in most of the pics that have been posted. A close-up shot, one showing off her legs, and a black and white version of her in the said dress are part of this #tbt offering. Although the final picture shows her in a sort of sweater getup, the rest of the pics are a bit more revealing. You can see the photos below:</p><p>Sofia Vergara currently has a massive 24.6 million followers on her Instagram, and this collection of photos has already garnered well over 60,000 likes and 400 comments. Most of the people commenting are using the heart face emojis to signify their acceptance of her beauty. We have heart eyes for her too. Vergara is a Colombian-born model and actress who rose to prominence in the 1990s while working for the Spanish-language television channel, Univision. It wasn’t until 2004 that she landed her first English-speaking role in Chasing Papi (2003), which she followed up with by appearing in Four Brothers (2005). She worked her way into primetime television with her massive role as Gloria Delgado-Pritchett&nbsp;in the hit ABC sitcom, Modern Family.</p><p>Due to her popularity on Modern Family, Sofia Vergara was nominated for four Golden Globes, four Primetime Emmy Awards, and eleven Screen Actors Guild Awards. Vergara was the highest-paid actress on American television from 2013 to 2020. She most recently appeared in the animated film, Koati, which was released in 2021. Though her acting career has been relatively quiet since leaving Modern Family, she is set to appear in one of her biggest roles. Sofia Vergara has been tapped to play former <a href=#>drug lord</a>, Griselda Blanco. Blanco’s story was made famous by the documentary, Cocaine Cowboys 2, which details the rise of cocaine in 1990s Miami. The new series, Griselda, is set to premiere on Netflix and began filming last month. She looks almost <a href=#>unrecognizable </a>in the first-look pic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sofia-vergara-griselda-1642667593.jpeg><p>Sofia Vergara has worked her way through Hollywood since the 1990s and with her new leading role as a drug lord, it seems as if her career is set to take off once again. Netflix certainly makes some quality programming and the Cocaine Cowboys documentaries have been fantastic. Though the new <a href=#>Griselda </a>series is a live-action recreation, it sure looks to be exciting. Vergara could find herself in much more prominent roles based on her performance in the upcoming series. The show is being produced by Sofia Vergara and Luis Balaguer.</p><p>Although the above image shows a much different-looking Sofia Vergara, she remains one of the most beautiful women on the planet. Her acting skills have clearly been fantastic due to her accolades on television and more, and she might blow everyone away when Griselda drops on Netflix. Either way, keep doing your thing, Ms. Vergara, especially if that thing is posting pics of low-cut dresses on your Instagram.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tno6Szqq2Mr5yrn5Gnrm7AyKCfrWWUp7K0v42hq6ak</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
