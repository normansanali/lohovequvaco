I think it’s 50/50.”</p><p>However, Chris said he “disagreed” and argued he “compromises more.”</p><h2>FANS CALL AMY ‘SPOILED’</h2><p>Shortly after the interview aired, fans rushed to Twitter to slam <a href=#>Amy</a> for making the wedding about herself.</p><p>One person wrote: “Does Chris want a wife or WARDEN!!!!!!!!!!!!”</p><p>Another accused Amy of not compromising, stating: “Amy’s parents must have really spoiled her. Boy, she has to have it her way!”</p><p>A third mocked Amy by impersonating the TV star as they tweeted: “Amy: I think the groom wanted to be way more involved in the wedding planning than I thought.”</p><p>An additional viewer called Amy “extra,” as another chimed in: “Amy is so contrary.”</p><h2>ALL ABOUT AMY</h2><p>The backlash from TLC fans is nothing new, as Little People, Big World fans <a href=#>slammed Amy last week for making her wedding to Chris “all about herself.”</a></p><p>After&nbsp;<a href=#>Amy</a>&nbsp;went wedding dress shopping, she visited her son&nbsp;<a href=#>Zach</a>&nbsp;and daughter-in-law&nbsp;<a href=#>Tori</a>&nbsp;to vent about her frustrations regarding Chris.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>Little People, Big World</a>&nbsp;star complained that Chris has different ideas for the wedding, which meant she had to compromise on many of her plans.</p><p>As the conversation played out onscreen, Tori criticized her mother-in-law in a confessional for making the wedding about herself.</p><p>Tori, 30, said she noticed Amy was acting like the wedding is only for her and not a celebration of her marriage to Chris.</p><p>She said: “It’s not ‘my wedding,’ it’s not ‘my marriage.’ It is ‘OUR wedding’ and so when Zach wanted to be a part of it, like, ‘You should have input on our wedding day.’”</p><h2>FANS SIDE WITH TORI</h2><p>Viewers agreed with Tori, as many took to Twitter to slam the mother of four.</p><p>One person wrote: “Amy has no insight.”</p><p>Another added: “Tori is right in that she has to be part of the wedding and the marriage between Amy and Chris!”</p><p>A third chimed in: “Tori just gets it. OUR wedding. OUR marriage.”</p><p>One viewer said they think Tori “low key doesn’t care” for Amy, as another wrote: “Amy use to talk about her love for Chris. Now she talks about a wedding.”</p><p>Amy continued to receive backlash for how she’s handling wedding planning, as someone else commented: “Amy is clearly obsessed with marrying Chris!!”</p><p>Someone else noted that the engaged couple need to work on their relationship, writing: “Is it just me, or do Chris & Amy need an Intervention??”</p><p>Earlier in the episode,&nbsp;<a href=#>Amy stunned as she tried on different wedding dresses</a>&nbsp;in preparation for the big day.</p><h2>BRIDEZILLA</h2><p>Amy and Chris, 59, will tie the knot at&nbsp;<a href=#>Roloff Farms in Hillsboro, Oregon</a>&nbsp;on August 28th.</p><p>As the couple have shared their wedding planning process with fans on the show, some have slammed the motivational speaker for&nbsp;<a href=#>her “controlling” nature.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000669038494-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000627698393-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000670742705-1.jpg><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Thesun.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnnJ7BtbjEZqeep6Chsm6ywKeqZquclrpurcyyZKunnKSzp3nFqKlmmZOptq%2BzjKamq51dobassYyaZLCZopmyr3nToZinZZFixKqyxGaYpqGUYsSmsMOipaBloKGur7rIp55mr5mptW6vx6ugrGWdlr%2Bmt44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
