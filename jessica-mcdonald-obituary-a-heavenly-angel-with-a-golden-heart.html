Jessica, often known as “Sassy Pants,” was a source of motivation for many people due to her optimistic approach and boundless inventiveness. Her passing away on November 28th, 2023, has left a void in our lives. Not only was Jessica a friend, but she was also a source of inspiration and delight for all who knew her. Not only did her contagious grin and laughter illuminate even the darkest corners of a room, but they also had the ability to elevate emotions.</p><p>The zest that Jessica had for life was unparalleled, and it showed in everything she did, whether it was singing, dancing, participating in pageants, bowling, or playing baseball. In addition to her vivacious personality, Jessica exemplified love that was not conditional. She loved everyone and everything, and those who were fortunate enough to experience her kindness were left with an indelible memory. It was clear that this gorgeous angel was pure and innocent because of her dedication to others. As we grieve “Sassy Pants,” we find comfort in knowing that Jessica is with her departed loved ones in paradise.</p><p>Jessica spreads her light at a world beyond our understanding by dancing with Grandma Judith Clark, hugging Aunt Glenda, and laughing with dead family members like Jacci. Despite the fact that Jessica is no longer with us, our memories of her will live on. We are going to never forget the teachings that she taught us about love, compassion, and happiness. Remembering Jessica McDonald, an angel who touched our lives, let us celebrate her wonderful soul. Although we will grieve for you, Jessica, we will never forget you. Heavenly rest is yours.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKKVqMCqr8BmpJycn6OurbCMqJmirKWWv7p5wGafnpmmmrutxYyapaCdnGLEqsDHZphmn5%2Bhsaa6jKGcmqqkZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
