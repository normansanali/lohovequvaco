Mr Justice Lewison, who was ruling on a copyright battle between two British rap bands, even pondered the idea of inviting a drug dealer into the court as an expert witness to end the confusion.
The judge had been asked to rule on a case brought by the band Ant'ill Mob against a rival outfit, the Heartless Crew."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I think that he is right, although the occasions on which an expert drug dealer might be called to give evidence in the Chancery Division are likely to be rare."</p><p>Mr Justice Lewison said the fact that the lyrics were hard to "decipher" also mitigated against the case.</p><p>As for Mr Alcee's complaint that he had suffered prejudice from the rap's violent invitation to "string dem up", the judge said he had seen a video of Ant'ill Mob, of which Mr Alcee was a member, dressed as 1930s gangsters.</p><p>As to whether "string dem up" - if those words were used on the album, which was unclear - was an invitation to lynching, the judge said a proponent of capital punishment who said murderers should be strung up would usually be taken to be advocating the return of the hangman rather than lynching.</p><p>The judge said a fundamental weakness in Mr Alcee's case was that the court had no evidence about his honour or reputation or of any prejudice caused.</p><p>He dismissed Mr Alcee's damages claim against East West Records, a division of Warner Music UK, which used Burnin on Heartless Crew's album Crisp Biscuit.</p><p>The judge also rejected a claim by Confetti Records and Fundamental Records, owners of the copyright in Burnin, that the track had been used without permission.</p><p>The judge ruled that a valid contract existed under which East West Records was licensed to use the track on the album.</p><p>Burnin had "proved very popular" and was number one in the official UK Garage Top 10 for the Heartless Crew in November 2001.</p><p>Mr Justice Lewison, at just 50 years of age, is one of the younger members of the judiciary. He was appointed in April this year after 28 years as a barrister.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwwcqnnLCrX2aBdH6QbHBoi59ixKmt02acsZmTqbm6ecisZKygma%2FHrbGMprBmppmvx62xjaGrpqQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
