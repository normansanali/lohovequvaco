Their last NFL championship victory came before the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. Here are the details about their last NFL championship wins and their performance in the postseason since then:</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Detroit Lions NFL Championship Wins</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Detroit Lions have won the NFL championship four times before the 1970 AFL-NFL merger. They claimed victory in the following years:</p><ul data-mce-fragment=1><li data-mce-fragment=1>In 1935, they won their first NFL championship by defeating the New York Giants with a score of 26-7 at the University of Detroit Stadium in Detroit, Michigan.</li><li data-mce-fragment=1>In 1952, they secured their second NFL championship by defeating the Cleveland Browns with a score of 17-7 at Cleveland Municipal Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio.</li><li data-mce-fragment=1>In 1953, they won their third NFL championship by defeating the Cleveland Browns with a score of 17-16 at Briggs Stadium in Detroit.</li><li data-mce-fragment=1>Their fourth and last NFL championship victory came in 1957, where they defeated the Cleveland Browns with a score of 59-14 at Briggs Stadium in Detroit.</li></ul><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Detroit Lions Super Bowl Appearances</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Detroit Lions have never reached the Super Bowl. They are one of the 12 teams in the NFL that have never won a Super Bowl and one of the four teams that have never played in one. Since their last NFL championship victory in 1957, the Lions have not won any championship until now.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Postseason Performance</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Detroit Lions have a playoff record of 7 wins and 13 losses. Their last playoff victory was in 1991, when they defeated the Dallas Cowboys in the Divisional Round. Since the 1970 merger, the Lions have only managed to secure one playoff win. They last made the playoffs in 2016, and the team lost eight straight playoff games in the Wild Card round.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Lions' Recent Performance</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>In 2023, the Detroit Lions were considered a real Super Bowl contender with an outside shot to be the top seed in the NFC. With the hiring of Dan Campbell as head coach in 2021, the franchise has been steadily building and is now seen as a legitimate contender to win the Super Bowl. Former Cowboys QB Tony Romo even stated that the Lions are a formidable team that can win a Super Bowl. Running back David Montgomery also emphasized the positive culture that Campbell has built within the team.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Given their historical success in the NFL championship era and their recent resurgence as a competitive team in the league, the Detroit Lions continue to strive for their first Super Bowl appearance and victory. Despite the team's association with playoff losses and disappointment, their loyal fan base remains hopeful for a breakthrough in the Super Bowl era.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Detroit Lions have never won a Super Bowl, and their last NFL championship victory dates back to 1957. As they continue to strive for success in the modern NFL, their rich history and dedicated fan base keep the hope alive for a future Super Bowl victory.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn56mXayutHnToZxmpJGowW7AyKacZqyYmnqlsdOrpqKsXaG2sLrSZq6opl2WerTBz56pm6enoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
