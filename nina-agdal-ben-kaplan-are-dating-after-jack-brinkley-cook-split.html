Nearly five months after <a href=#><strong>Nina Agdal</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jack Brinkley-Cook</strong></a> broke up,&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>can confirm she has moved on with <strong>Ben Kaplan</strong>.</p><p class=p1>“They’re definitely together,” a source exclusively tells&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>of the model, 30, and the What Do You Meme? founder, noting they were recently <a href=#>spotted at LAX airport “canoodling”</a> earlier this month. “They were hand-in-hand the whole time. His arm was on the small of her back. She seemed super happy.”</p><p class=p1>The insider adds that the twosome’s romance is still “relatively new.”</p><p class=p1>While the duo have not publicly addressed their budding connection, Kaplan is a successful businessman in his own right, launching the popular card game, What Do You Meme?, in 2016.</p><p class=p1>“We kind of all have our role in the company, which I think makes us really efficient,” Kaplan told <a href=#>ABC News</a> in September 2016. “So all content decisions<strong> Elliot [Tebele]</strong> takes care of and anything that involves being really smart <strong>Ellie [Ballas]</strong> takes care of. He graduated from Stanford with a major in symbolic systems, which is like the hardest major in the world, and then all the easy stuff I do, so together we each have our role.”</p><p class=p1>The Denmark native’s relationship with Kaplan comes less than five months after she and <a href=#><strong>Christie Brinkley</strong></a>’s son, 26, <a href=#>went their separate ways</a>.</p><p class=p1><i>Us</i>&nbsp;previously confirmed that Agdal and the Rove founder, who she had been dating since 2017, had <a href=#>split in November 2021 after four years together</a>.</p><p class=p1>“Everything is good,” the Agdal Method founder <a href=#>previously told&nbsp;<i>Us</i>&nbsp;in September 2019&nbsp;</a>of their romance. “Oh, my God, well, we’re not perfect. No relationship is perfect, but I think we just have a really sincere love for each other, and we support each other, we respect each other and we just love you each other!”</p><p class=p1>Agdal and Brinkley Cook first sparked dating speculation in July 2017 amid her split from <a href=#><strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></a>. The&nbsp;<i>Sports Illustrated Swimsuit&nbsp;</i>model and the Oscar winner, 47, <a href=#>dated for nearly one year until calling it quits in May 2017</a>.</p><p class=p1>While Agdal has <a href=#>remained relatively coy about her love life</a>, she knows exactly what she is looking for in a potential partner.</p><p class=p1>“If we have the same humor, we’re definitely going to get along and you will have a sweet spot in my heart,” she told&nbsp;<a href=#><i>W&nbsp;</i>magazine</a> in November 2016. “[Because] I love people that can laugh in good situations, bad situations and I just love weirdness. I’m all about embracing that!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She continued: “I think <a href=#>it all comes down to a solid, good-hearted, smart, funny and happy</a> man because if you have all of that, that’s all I want. So, I think you would be on the same page. [It’s] pretty simple.”</p><p class=p4><i>With reporting by Diana Cooper</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGanoZ6WeqKzw5qjZpqVo3qsrc%2BlmKdlkaeybrDAraCnn12Ws7Wx0WahmpubYq%2Bztc2ko56xXZi8sLeMrKeloaRk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
