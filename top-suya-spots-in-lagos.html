Beyond the taste and the spiciness of its suya, Belton suya spot is very affordable. As a first time visitor at Belton, you would find out that the suyas are displayed in large quantities which would leave you in doubt whether or not you are buying leftover Suyas from the previous day, only to find out they are suya made on that day. Such is the high demand of Suya at Belton. Many have come to claim that its suya is the best in the gbagada and Pedro area of Lagos mainland. Something worthy of note is that parking spaces are inadequate, so you might want to go prepared if you intend visiting with your vehicle. Oh! the Chicken suya is quite pricy but it would be best you be the judge of that! ?</p><p><strong>Address:</strong> Oguntona Cresent, Pedro, Lagos</p><p><strong>Opening Time:</strong> 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM (Mondays – Sundays)</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=notable-mentions-suya-spots-in-lagos></span> Notable Mentions (Suya Spots in Lagos)<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>Kaza Grill and Suya Spot</strong> – (Address: Akowonjo, Ikeja).
