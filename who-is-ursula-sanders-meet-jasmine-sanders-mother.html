Thanks for teaching me everything I know, traveling with me, waiting with me at castings, listening to me cry at night, and letting my lay my head on your stomach while you rub your hands through my hair.. I love you Mommy and can’t thank you enough for all of your support!”</p><p>She concluded the post, “Thanks for always keeping it real with me <span class="x3nfvp2 x1j61x8r x1fcty0u xdj266r xhhsvwb xat24cr xgzva0m xxymvpz xlup9mm x1kky2od"><img alt=❤️ width=16 height=16 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/ted/2/16/2764.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span> My Mommy and Forever Best Friend <span class="x3nfvp2 x1j61x8r x1fcty0u xdj266r xhhsvwb xat24cr xgzva0m xxymvpz xlup9mm x1kky2od"><img alt=❤️ width=16 height=16 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/ted/2/16/2764.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span> Can’t wait til I can come home and see you when everything opens back up! @ursulasandersmua @ Los Angeles, California.”</p><p>As reported, model Jasmine was also Elite World Group Virtual’s first avatar, the company that represented her.</p><p>Jasmine’s exotic looks aided in her thriving modeling career. She has been in the modeling business for a very long time and worked for several notable brands including Tommy Hilfiger, Fendi, and Bulgari. But, it wasn’t always like that for her.</p><p>Jasmine experienced racism-based bullying as a child at her school (her mother is white and her father is Black). “Living in the South, people look at you differently because you are a mixed kid. I would get bullied over who my friends were — if I had too many white friends or too many black friends,”&nbsp; In 2018, she spoke to Ocean Drive.</p><p>At the age of 13, Jasmine joined her first modeling agency. Up until the age of 18, her mother accompanied her in every photo session and campaign.</p><p>Julia Haart wanted to go digital with the company when she worked at EWG. Julia intended to make famous people into avatars and introduce them to the Metaverse. Jasmine was the brand’s initial persona when the My Unorthodox Life star introduced the idea. In an interview with NBC News at the beginning of 2022, Julia claimed that “hyper-realistic avatars” could enable users to “be everywhere at once.”</p><h3><strong>Ursula Sanders Husband And Kids</strong></h3><p>Ursula Sanders met her husband <a href=#>Andre Sanders</a> when Andre was serving in the military in Germany. The couple had Jasmine in Germany and later Ursula and Jasmine moved to Columbia, S.C. when Jas was around 1 year old. Jasmine has spoken about her father with Arcadia.</p><p>Jasmine said: “My dad is ex-military and he is a machine, he’s turned me into one too. When I was a kid, he used to say ‘it is a gift and a curse to be a girl.’ You’ve got to know how to protect yourself. He taught me to always be completely aware of my surroundings. Have fun at the club, but never let your guard down too much.”</p><p>“I appreciate my dad in so many ways, but especially for teaching me how to protect myself ahead of time,” she added more. “He taught me how to watch people like no other.”</p><p>By ethnicity, Andre is African-American and hailed from South Carolina. By profession, he was an ex-military. Jas described him as a machine. Born in 1960, Andre is 62 years old in April 2022.</p><p>Other than Jasmine, Andre and Ursula also have other two sons; Marco and Dominique, and a daughter named Alisha.
