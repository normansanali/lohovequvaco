In the snap, the Soules men grin and stand in a lush green field with red Solo cups in hand.</p><p>Also helping Soules move past his split have been his nieces. One niece made her uncle Chris a lovely breakfast on Monday comprised of bacon, toast with butter, fruit, a Kind bar, and orange juice. She even spruced up the meal with a tiny vase of flowers. "Breakfast made by my lovely niece Sienna," Soules shared.</p><p>The proud uncle also took a photo with another family member who graduated this past Sunday. "My niece Hannah Wallace who graduated on Sunday!" the DWTS alum wrote alongside the photo. "I am so proud of her! Can't wait to be a part of her amazing future!"</p><p>His latest social media updates come in the wake of his split from Bischoff, which was announced last Thursday, May 28.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Whitney Bischoff and Chris Soules have mutually and amicably decided to end their engagement," the pair said in <a href=#>their joint statement to <strong>Us</strong></a>.&nbsp;"They part with nothing but respect and admiration for one another and will continue to be supportive friends. They wish to thank everyone who has supported them through this journey."</p><p>Soules <a href=#>broke his silence</a> about the breakup on Friday. "I can't thank you all enough for the kind messages over the past few days," he tweeted. "This has been really tough and your support means a lot to me."</p><p>Bischoff <a href=#>echoed his sentiments</a> earlier that day by thanking fans for their "outpouring love, kindness, and support."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoKKewG6%2Fzq6jnqtdqL2musOsZK2hnZp6uLXToWSfmZ2eubp5zqdkn5mionqistOeqWaroKG2tXnPoaatp6Nif3F9lGttaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
