News</a>, Jackie is confirming that she has always been filming no matter what the decision the network decides to go in, noting that it’s out of her hands.</p><p>“I filmed yesterday, I’m filming tomorrow, I’m filming all next week,” Jackie revealed to the outlet. “So really, no matter what&nbsp;Bravo’s decides—and sometimes they make these decisions at the last second—no matter what they decide, I go into filming doing the same exact thing that I’ve been doing for the past five years.”</p><p>Jackie continued,&nbsp;“I’m really okay with anything because it’s out of my hands. That being said, I don’t know what they’re going to ultimately decide. But whatever they do decide, I’m fine with it.”</p><p>During the interview, Jackie also let some tidbits slide about Teresa’s upcoming nuptials. To put it lightly, the two have a tumultuous history at best, but Jackie seems to have a change of tune as she’s excited to see Teresa walk to the altar.</p><p>“Despite the fact that Teresa and I have had our ups and downs, I really do want to see her have a happy ending,” the freelance writer said. “I love a wedding. I think it’s beautiful.”</p><p>Jackie also showed some love to Luis as well saying that he and Teresa’s relationship has become a “full circle” moment.</p><p>“I really like&nbsp;Louie&nbsp;and everyone really likes&nbsp;Louie and I think it’s really nice to see their relationship come full circle,” Jackie added. “We all saw when she was single and then when she met him and their courtship—so it’s fun to see her get married.”</p><p>As for who is attending the New Jersey ceremony, Jackie kept her response close to the chest and said she is not “privy” to the rest of the guest list.</p><p>“I wasn’t privy to everyone’s invitation,” Jackie explained. “But you never know.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</strong> </a>season 13 is currently filming and you can catch up on past seasons available to stream on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toopGYuKqxjKCmpZyjmLWvscidnKtln6N6s7TOp6Fmq5WWwLC6jGpqZpuRqMFuvtSmpqurXamys7HSmmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
