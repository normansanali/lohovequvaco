The former couple’s relationship had previously been tested in 2010 when Kody requested a divorce to legally marry his new partner, Robyn Brown, and adopt her children, but the pair stayed together in a “spiritual” union.</p><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=457 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It was a catfishing scandal</a> that happened years later that led to the relationship’s ultimate demise. Meri was duped into an online romance with a man named Sam Cooper, who was eventually revealed to be a woman posing under a false identity online. While Meri admitted the incident did not directly cause their split, the messages she exchanged with “Sam” planted seeds in her mind about her marital issues, causing her to push Kody away.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-meri-brown-s-new-boyfriend-amos data-injectable=false>Who is Meri Brown’s new boyfriend, Amos?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Meri Brown (@therealmeribrown)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=593 data-injectable=true>While only referred to as Amos in Meri’s Instagram post, the reality star’s new beau’s reported full name is Amos Andrews. According to Meri’s following list on the social media app, it appears that Amos does not have an Instagram account — or at least, a public one.</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>On an Instagram Live session as part of Meri’s weekly Fridays with Friends show, Amos appeared alongside his new girlfriend. In a discussion with Meri’s close friend Jen Sullivan, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it was revealed that Amos has three ex-wives</a>. However, this doesn’t appear to bother the former polygamist.</p><p data-characters=115 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>“I sort of have three ex-sister wives and an ex-husband. I beat you,” Meri teased during the interview.</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>With little social media footprint, it is currently unconfirmed how old Amos is, or what he does for a living. It is also unknown if, like Meri, he has children from his previous marriages. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Meri shares one child, Leon, with ex-husband Kody</a>. While Amos may be dating a reality TV star, he is admittedly shy of the spotlight</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=669 data-injectable=true>“I think it was the second time we talked. He was like, ‘Yeah, I’m a really private person,'” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Meri recalled on Instagram live</a>. “I’m like, ‘Really?’ He’s like, ‘Yeah. I’m not on social media. I’m a really private person. I don’t let a lot of people into my life.'”</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>On Instagram, Meri stated that she and Amos have been dating since October, but did not confirm when — or where — the two first crossed paths. She did, however, admit she “did pursue him,” and that she made the first move.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Meri-and-Leon-Brown.jpg><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=334 data-injectable=false>Last summer, Meri’s only child, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Leon Brown, married their long term partner, Audrey Kriss</a>, in a secret ceremony only reported months later. According to reports surrounding the nuptials, neither Meri nor Kody attended the ceremony, where Audrey and Leon were apparently the only people in attendance for the courthouse wedding.</p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=679 data-injectable=true>So far, neither Meri nor Leon have commented on their family in recent weeks, but appeared to be on good terms, especially surrounding Meri’s support for Leon after they came out as transgender — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">something that Kody is allegedly against</a>. Regarding Meri’s new partner, there has been no word from Leon on the matter so far, either.</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>Amos did, however, get a very positive review from another family member — Meri’s dog, Zona, “absolutely loves” Amos, according to her original Instagram post. In the second picture of her celebratory photo dump announcing their relationship, Zona can be seen adorably holding hands (or paws) with his owner’s new partner.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y0tdKtnKtlp57Dpr%2BMsJ%2BoZZmoeq6x0aJkm6qfrLu0ec2ermaan66zs7XEp5to</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
