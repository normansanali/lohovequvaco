Speaking on the <a href=#>"WTF With Marc Maron"</a>&nbsp;podcast, the "Bad Moms" actor dished that they're not on good terms following their split. "[We're] probably not as friendly as we could be, no," she said. "There are too many aspects of it that just prevented us from ever moving forward [from the] past. We dated from when I was like, 18, 19 until 25ish."</p><p>Apparently, their breakup was largely her fault, with the star detailing in an episode of Dax Shephard's <a href=#>"Armchair Expert"</a> podcast that she regrets how she dealt with everything back then. While she was a bit stingy on the details, she implied that she wasn't on her best behavior. "I had a horrible, horrible, horrible breakup," she said. "I f**ked up. I was an a**hole in my 20s, and I'll be the first to admit it. And that's kind of something that took me a long time to come out and be like, 'Yeah, you know what? I was a d**k,' and accept it. And I own it now."</p><p>Meanwhile, Culkin has never spoken of their relationship after they separated. However, he shared on the "Anna Faris Is Unqualified" podcast that <a href=#>being with Brenda Song</a> was the first time a partner had treated him well. "She just does nice things, and I feel like I'm almost, like, at first, I didn't know how to be treated well in that kind of way," he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtlZ4Vzf46mmJyZpaGuunnCrqOkoZ5iuqq4wGairqaZqHqou86dZK2doqLAbq3FrZyrZZKnsqK31Klm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
