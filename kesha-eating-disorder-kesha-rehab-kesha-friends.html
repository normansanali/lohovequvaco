I’ll be unavailable for the next 30 days, seeking treatment for my eating disorder… to learn to love myself again, exactly as I am.”</p><p>The public attributed Kesha's weight loss to just toning up and training hard, and so did her pals, at least at first. “With her, she is such the life of the party that people didn’t notice it and thought she was just getting in shape,” a source <a href=#>revealed</a>. "She would hide all the bad stuff from those that are close to her.”</p><p>But the 'Die Young' songstress couldn't hide it for long. “Friends started seeing around Thanksgiving that something was wrong and started talking to her to get help," the insider said. "Thankfully, she took their advice and is getting the help she needs.”</p><p>Here's hoping she also gets some help with her label relations. If rumor is to be believed, Kesha and <a href=#>Dr. Luke</a> are <a href=#>butting heads</a> in a big way -- and that may have contributed to her ED. Get well soon, Kesha! We love you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6Wws8HSoWWcp51kuKa%2Fx5pknpmknruoecOiqqiqlJq%2FbrfErJ%2BaZaKataKujKScrKCRYrOztcSnm6xn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
