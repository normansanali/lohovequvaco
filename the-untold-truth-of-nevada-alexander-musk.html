Elon Musk is a technology entrepreneur.</strong></p><p><strong>A number of businesses, including Tesla, SpaceX, OpenAI, Neuralink, Paypal, and The Boring Company, would be founded by his father.</strong></p><h2><span id=The_Nevadan_Economy_Musk_Alexander>The Nevadan Economy Musk, Alexander</span></h2><p>Nevada Alexander Musk didn’t get to experience any fortune because he <strong>died</strong> at the age of just 10 weeks.

Although he had planned and imagined the business that would become SpaceX, he lacked cash at the time.</p><p>The offer to buy Paypal from him for <strong>$1.5 billion</strong> from eBay then came up. He was enjoying watching Nevada grow from a baby to a few weeks old as the deal was being finalized.</p><p>Elon’s daughter Nevada is the result of his <strong>marriage</strong> to the author and former college sweetheart Justine Wilson. He passed away suddenly and without prior notice.</p><p>When his parents went to bed and came back, he had stopped breathing. He had been without oxygen for such a long time that his brain was no longer functioning properly when the paramedics were called and they were able to revive him.</p><p>Before the parents turned off the life support, he was kept alive for three days.</p><p>Elon and his wife both mourned openly after the death, but he chose to remain silent because he didn’t want to discuss it. He’s not the kind of guy to linger in a dark area, so the two wanted to get going right away.</p><p>They would have twins, then triplets, during the following five years.</p><h2><span id=Infant_Sudden_Death_Syndrome>Infant Sudden Death Syndrome</span></h2><p>According to medical professionals, Nevada Alexander’s death was caused by SIDS or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.</p><p>Children younger than a year of age frequently experience sudden, unexplained deaths. Despite the fact that it usually happens when individuals are asleep, studies on the (said) sickness have not yet identified a cause.</p><p>There is no proof the child struggled or had any issues prior to dying. There have been many hypothesized causes of SIDS, however, none of them have been proven to exist.</p><p>Experts and medical professionals advise minimizing the child’s exposure to hazards. To do this, they advise using a hard mattress and only allowing a youngster to sleep face-up.</p><p>Additionally, they advise keeping the infant cool and away from smoke. SIDS is thought to account for the majority of unexpected newborn fatalities. The child’s immune system may benefit from practices like nursing and immunization.</p><h2><span id=Musk8217s_father_is_Elon>Musk’s father is Elon</span></h2><p>Elon was born and raised in Pretoria, South Africa, and later immigrated to Canada to attend Queen’s University for his undergraduate studies.</p><p>He spent<strong> two years</strong> there before relocating to the US to attend the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned degrees in physics and economics.</p><p>Then he enrolled at Stanford University to seek a Ph.D. in applied physics, but he soon withdrew when he decided he wanted to become an entrepreneur instead.</p><p>He rapidly became a millionaire once the online software company proved profitable and was ultimately purchased by Compaq for<strong> $340 million.</strong></p><p>Then he founded X.com, an online bank that would later develop into PayPal in <strong>2000.</strong> Another successful commercial venture was acquired by eBay for<strong> $1.5 billion</strong>, bringing Elon’s net worth above <strong>$1 billion</strong>. Since then, he has founded and led numerous businesses.</p><p>He founded both the electric automobile manufacturer Tesla and the aerospace and space transportation business SpaceX. Through OpenAI, he also wants to develop<strong> amiable artificial intelligence</strong>. His main objective is to lessen global warming.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life_of_Elon>Personal Life of Elon</span></h2><p>Elon had five more in vitro fertilized children with Justine Wilson after Nevada Alexander passed away. They were <strong>married</strong> for eight years until divorcing in <strong>2008</strong> after their separation; they have joint custody of their five children.</p><p>After they split up, he started dating actress Talula Riley. They got married two years later, although their marriage only lasted for two. They later made amends and got married again, but their erratic relationship <strong>ended in 2016.</strong></p><p>Elon then had a one-year romance with Amber Heard before meeting Canadian musician Grimes (Claire Elise Boucher) in <strong>2001.</strong> The two are reportedly still together now.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Is Eddie Huang Married, Dating, And Engaged</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a> <a href=# rel=tag>celebrity child</a></span><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Shi Yang</a></h3>Shi Yang estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
