Written by Kristian Corfixen, the book was based on real crime incidents in 2015. 'The Nurse: Inside Denmark's Most Sensational Criminal Trial' tells the story of a nurse at the Nykøbing Falster Hospital, named Christina Aistrup Hansen who was accused of murdering her patients. Her serial killing came to light in March 2015, when the Danish police got a call from the hospital. A close colleague of Christina Aistrup Hansen told police that she suspected her fellow nurse of killing patients and further added that it might happen again if she wasn't stopped. After the police investigated, one of the most horrifying murder cases in Danish was revealed.</p><p>The case of Christina Aistrup Hansen is interesting because there is no evidence that connected her with the said murder victims who were cremated. But the suspicious nature of her activities was reported by several of her co-workers though none of them could prove her guilt. The real-world case of Christina Aistrup Hansen ended with her getting charged with four murders and attempted murder along with stripping of her authorization as a nurse in 2016. It has been later revealed that Christina Aistrup Hansen had a histrionic personality disorder. This true crime story is a terrifying one, from start to finish. And Netflix's adaptation promises some thrilling fictionalized elements.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>What is Netflix's adaptation of 'The Nurse' about?</h2><p>The official logline of the upcoming limited series reads, "One early morning in March 2015, the Danish police received a call from a nurse at Nykøbing Falster Hospital. She suspects her close colleague of deliberately killing patients and fears that it has just happened again. Soon a murder case unfolds like never seen before in Danish legal history. Several co-workers are now telling the police that they also suspect the nurse has poisoned patients, and some even tell that they have been walking around with this suspicion for several years. But why hasn't anyone responded? And where is the evidence? The Nurse is based on the true story of the Danish nurse, Christina Aistrup Hansen, who was sentenced to 12 years for four counts of attempted murder in 2017. The Nurse is based on the book of the same name written by Kristian Corfixen." The upcoming series promises us a gritty and nail-biting crime story.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/d3da6fa0-badc-4078-8d02-2064391b40fb.jpg><p>'The Nurse' is available to stream exclusively on Netflix on April 27, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRorJiaeq%2FB0aycZqeeYrumwMWloLFlpJ2ybrTAq6mor5mjtG7A0a6cZqukpL%2B6ecGen6KmlGKxorrIrJ9mm6KeuqZ506GpoqScmr9ugpBub3Fo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
