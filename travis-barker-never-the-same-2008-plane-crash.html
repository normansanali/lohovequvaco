For example, he stopped using hard drugs after the incident. "People are always like, 'Did you go to rehab?' And I [say], 'No, I was in a plane crash.' That was my rehab. Lose three of your friends and almost die? That was my wake-up call. If I wasn't in a crash, I would have probably never quit," he admitted during his interview with Men's Health. Moreover, Barker refused to set foot on another plane. For years, the musician traveled by any and all other methods of transportation, including cars, boats, and trains, but he couldn't bring himself to fly.&nbsp;</p><p>However, all of that changed when Barker started dating Kourtney Kardashian. Thirteen years after the crash that nearly claimed his life, Barker decided to fly again. In August 2021, <a href=#>TMZ</a> posted photos of Barker stepping off an airplane in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. "Travis getting on that plane was a big trip for him. It meant a lot that he was able to overcome his fear of flying because of Kourtney," a source told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> following the flight. In the time since, Barker has flown about 30 times.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtnboB2g46tqZqumah6o63RpJyrZZ6aw6a%2BjK2fnmWjlrqmeZFpZ3FloKGur7GMnKmaq5hk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
