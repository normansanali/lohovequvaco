Source: Bravo; CBSIf you wondered how the Peacock reality competition show The Traitors could out-do itself after a second season of twists, turns, and backstabbing among favorite reality stars, think again. Because the cast for Season 3 of The Traitors is here, and the list includes multiple Real Housewives drama queens, a certain participant in the Vanderpump Rules &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Because the cast for Season 3 of The Traitors is here, and the list includes multiple Real Housewives drama queens, a certain participant in the Vanderpump Rules "Scandoval" incident, and even the ex of a pretty iconic pop star.</p><p>The name of the game is either tricking other players into not thinking you're a secret traitor, or politicking to get someone else out of the house. And in the end, only one person can walk away with the grand prize of up to $250,000. Because, oh yeah, it's up to the players in various competitions to add to the prize fund as they win or lose games.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Peacock</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">'The Traitors' Season 3 cast also includes a distant relative of the British Royal family.</h2><p>In addition to the reality TV stars (which, in some cases, is a term used quite loosely), we have someone from the British monarchy in The Traitors Season 3 cast as well. King Charles III's second cousin, Lord Ivar Mountbatten, is also among the contestants.</p><p>To be fair, he isn't the first British aristocrat to be part of the show's cast. But hey, we'll take what we can get. To learn more about him and the other cast members this season, read on!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Wells Adams</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>You probably know Wells best from his time on The Bachelorette and later as the bartender on Bachelor in Paradise. It's a pretty cushy gig, but apparently, the promise of The Traitors prize money is too good to pass up. Outside of reality television, Wells is married to Modern Family star Sarah Hyland.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Robyn Dixon</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>Robyn was part of The Real Housewives of Potomac until Season 8, after which she was fired from the Bravo series. On her podcast, Reasonably Shady, Robyn explained, "The network did not invite me back. I was fired, for lack of better words." What better way to continue her reign on reality television than to try and best other reality TV stars on The Traitors?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Bob Harper</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@bobharper</a></figure><p>Bob was a trainer in the early days of The Biggest Loser. In later seasons, he became the host. But outside of the show, Bob is also a photographer and public speaker.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Carolyn Wiger</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>Carolyn was the runner-up in Season 44 of Survivor. And in a house with some reality show participants who might not know much about strategic game play, she could go pretty far on The Traitors.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Bob the Drag Queen</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@bobthedragqueen</a></figure><p>Bob the Drag Queen, also known as Caldwell Tidicue, hosts HBO's We're Here and also won Season 8 of RuPaul's Drag Race. He's also a comedian, though, with a comedy special called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Woke Man in a Dress</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Dylan Efron</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@dylanefron</a></figure><p>Nope, you aren't seeing things with that last name. Dylan is brother to none other than Zac Efron, but he does have a bit of reality TV experience, which earned him a spot on The Traitors. Dylan appeared in Down to Earth with Zac Efron on Netflix. Though having such a high profile relative could put an immediate target on Dylan's back.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Chanel Ayan</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>Chanel is known for causing drama and taking names on The Real Housewives of Dubai. Don't ask how she managed to film The Traitors between working on the second season of RHODubai and modeling, but apparently, she's a triple threat.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Dolores Catania</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>Dolores is yet another Real Housewives star to join The Traitors in Season 3. She joined The Real Housewives of New Jersey in 2016, and she has remained part of the cast ever since.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Dorinda Medley</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>Apparently, the third season of The Traitors also serves as a mini Real Housewives reunion. Dorinda was one of the most memorable ladies on The Real Housewives of New York until she left the show in 2020, and now she's yet another Bravo celebrity on The Traitors.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Jeremy Collins</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>Jeremy is known for competing in two seasons of Survivor and winning one of them. He was also in Survivor: Winners at War. But outside of reality TV, Jeremy is a doting dad of four.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Lord Ivar Mountbatten</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@ivar_mountbatten</a></figure><p>Lord Ivar Mountbatten is the second cousin of King Charles III. While that doesn't give him a claim to the throne, it does mean he's the closest thing to royalty that The Traitors will get, so that's something. He's also known for being an openly gay member of the royal family, and for marrying his husband in 2018.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Gabby Windey</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Gabby was one of the dual Bachelorette leads in Season 19. She left the show engaged to contestant Erich Schwer. Later, however, they announced their split. But don't worry, because Gabby shined bright as a second place winner on Dancing With the Stars afterwards.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Tom Sandoval</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>Tom might be one of the most recognizable reality stars to join The Traitors in Season 3. He was at the center of "Scandoval," a Vanderpump Rules scandal that rocked the cast when he admitted to having an affair and cheating on his longtime girlfriend with her friend and fellow castmate.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Chrishell Stause</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Whether you know her from soap operas or from Netflix's Selling Sunset, Chrishell has been a big part of television for years. And between being a reality TV star, actor, and real estate agent, she's also open to the idea of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">adopting children</a> to start a family.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Danielle Reyes</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>Danielle is one of those Big Brother alums who newer players can't help but be intimidated by. She competed in two seasons of the show, and later returned for its spinoff Reindeer Games.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">"Boston" Rob Mariano</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>Boston Rob competed in five seasons of Survivor and even mentored players in one season. He's also known for being part of the cast of the first season of Let's Make a Deal Island. While he didn't win, Boston Rob further cemented his spot as a reality competition icon.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Sam Asghari</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Sam is one of two cast members who isn't known for reality TV, but is still prevalent in the pop culture world. While he has professionally danced and modeled, and might be known for that in some circles, Sam is perhaps best known for being Britney Spears's ex-husband after their 2023 divorce.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Nikki Garcia</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@nikkigarcia</a></figure><p>Although Nikki and her sister, Brie Danielson, usually come as a pair, the "Bella Twins" aren't doing The Traitors together. Instead, Nikki is trying this solo, and outside of the show, she hosts the show Barmageddon.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Ciara Miller</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>To many, <a href=#>Ciara</a> is known for being part of Bravo's Summer House. But outside of the show, she is plenty busy, thanks to a double career as a nurse and as a model.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Britney Haynes</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>Britney is another Big Brother alum here to prove she has a solid social and physical game to either fool the other players into thinking she isn't a traitor or sniff out the traitors herself. As a Big Brother vet, she competed in two seasons of Big Brother before she returned for Big Brother Reindeer Games.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Tony Vlachos</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>Before Tony was announced as a cast member for Season 3 of The Traitors, he won two seasons of Survivor. Although that makes him a strong competitor, it also means he could have immediate unwanted attention from others who feel threatened by him.</p><p>The Season 3 premiere date for The Traitors has not yet been announced, but until it is, you can stream the other seasons on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWmedOrmKKsn6fAbr%2FEmqqopl1oeqSt0q0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
