Our close-knit group is deeply saddened by Todd’s leaving because he was not only our players’ coach but also a friend, mentor, and source of strength.</p><p>Todd was a dedicated member of the team for several seasons, serving as the strength and conditioning coach at crucial times. His influence went well beyond the field of play, as he committed himself to developing our players’ mental and emotional as well as physical toughness. Every facet of the game was impacted by Todd, but more significantly, his guidance had a lasting impact on the lives of the young players he trained.</p><p>As our “get back” coach on Friday nights, Todd was always there, wherever the squad went. His prompt attention to injuries and equipment failures demonstrated his professionalism and sincere care for our players’ welfare. Due to his unwavering commitment, Todd gained the respect and admiration of parents, players, and other coaches, making him a legendary figure in Poquoson High School Athletics history.</p><p>Todd made relationships that extended beyond the locker room and the sidelines. Every athlete who was fortunate enough to get his guidance and training felt his presence in their hearts. Everyone who had the honor of knowing him will deeply mourn his absence, since his impact on our program is irrevocable. As we tell Coach Todd DeForest farewell, we would like to express our sincere gratitude for his years of commitment to our program and, more significantly, to the development and welfare of our players. The people he coached and the lives he touched will always remember him. Peace be with you, Coach. We shall really miss you.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwwM6dm2aclZu8s7HSrWSompmpwqK%2B2GanqKmlpMCwuoyvmGaen6e6pr6MqZ%2BsZZakvLWuwKWjZpuflrCpedKam6WxXaWutL%2FEnWSar5GufA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
