After nearly three years without a new season of the show, fans eagerly awaited new storylines and villains that eventually graced the smaller screen via Netflix. After the series‚Äô return, Kate Bush‚Äôs ‚ÄúRunning Up That Hill‚Äù and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Metallica‚Äôs</a>&nbsp;‚ÄúMaster Of Puppets‚Äù became viral sensations on Twitter and TikTok. But not all is well on social media these days when it relates to the actors from&nbsp;Stranger Things.&nbsp;It seems that some of the famous performers like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Millie Bobby Brown</a>, Noah Schnapp, and Natalia Dyer have become targets of users who want to see their favorite stars in a new light, including changing their appearance altogether.</p><p>According to a report by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Newsweek</a>, a TikTok user posted a video about actor Natalia Dyer and all of the ways Dyer could utilize cosmetic surgery in order to fix some facial features. Never mind the fact that Dyer is a gorgeous 27-year-old famous star on one of the most successful television series in recent memory, but as a celebrity, she has been earmarked for criticism. In the video that has since been deleted from TikTok, a nurse practitioner in California named Miranda Wilson used the social media platform to discuss the various ways in which she could change Dyer‚Äôs face. Wilson apparently works in plastic surgery and felt that it was her duty to let the world know how Dyer‚Äôs frame could transform, including slimming her face for better jaw muscles, chin fillers, lip injections, and some botox. Wilson added that she would ‚Äúgive her a nice brow lift to help open up her eyes.‚Äù It is not apparent why Wilson focused on Dyer specifically, but the video has since been removed by the creator.</p><p>However, other social media users would not let Miranda Wilson criticize Natalia Dyer for long.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pop Buzz</a>&nbsp;reports that several Dyer fans have taken to social media this week to air their grievances on what Miranda Wilson initially posted before she took her video down. Posting their thoughts on Twitter, several fans opened up about their struggles with criticism and how difficult it must be for celebrities just wanting to do their job without the constant accusations of imperfection.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>she‚Äôs literally drop dead gorgeousüò≠I hate these kinds of tik toks</p>‚Äî jackie (@etrnalsunsets) <a href=#>July 24, 2022</a></figure><p>The TikTok video that Miranda Wilson posted showing how Natalia Dyer could change her face ended with a photoshopped version of a ‚Äúbefore‚Äù and ‚Äúafter‚Äù type of shot. Even though Dyer never asked for advice from Wilson, it seems that the plastic surgery aficionado felt that it was their place to provide guidance on how others should look. However, Dyer may be getting the last laugh as the Tennessee native embarks on filming the final season of&nbsp;Stranger Things&nbsp;while continuing her long-term relationship with costar <a href=#>Charlie Heaton</a>. With fans coming to her defense, it appears that Natalia Dyer may not need unsolicited help from a plastic surgery expert after all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irpKeur7PEq2StoJmjtLR5zZqrmqSZlnqlxcSrZJ%2BhqGK1pr6Mn5icnV6dwa64</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
