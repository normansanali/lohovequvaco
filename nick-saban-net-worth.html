He played as a midfielder and won various trophies before retiring after 15 years.</p><p>Fabio is known for his determination and no-nonsense attitude when managing his teams, resulting in league-winning results in Serie A in his first 4 out of 5 seasons at AC Milan.</p><p>As of January 2024, Fabio Capello’s net worth is estimated to be $90 Million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=fabio-capello-facts></span>Fabio Capello Facts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Fabio’s son, Pier Filippo, looks after the business side and acts as his agent.</li><li>He is an art enthusiast and has acquired numerous works with a collection worth $9.6 million.</li><li>As a player, he was most successful with Juventus, winning three Series A titles in 1972, 1973, and 1975.</li><li>When Fabio played for Italy, he was capped 32 times while scoring 8 goals as well.</li><li>While coaching Milan, he won the 1993–94 UEFA Champions League after defeating Barcelona 4–0.</li><li>As a devout Catholic, Fabio is known to pray at least twice daily.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life></span>Early Life&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fabio Capello was <a href=# rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabio_Capello data-lasso-id=105041 data-wpel-link=external>born June 18, 1946</a>. Born in San Canzian d’Isonzo, Italy.</p><p>His parents, Evelina and Guerrino Capello, were a school teacher and a homemaker. His father and uncle were both football players, so it was natural that Fabio became so interested in the sport from an early age.</p><p>His uncle, Mario Tortul, played football for Triestina, Padova, and the Italy national team in 1960.</p><p>Still, a young Fabio was discovered by Paolo Mazza (the president of SPAL), who immediately signed him for 2 million Iire.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span>Career&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While playing for SPAL, Fabio was able to show off his talent as a midfielder. But, due to a knee injury, he had to take time off from his football career.</p><p>He returned in 1967, moving to Roma and then, after a great performance, and his career with the new club took off by helping the team come in first even with the reoccurrence of his injured knee. Despite his injury setback, Fabio performed well and was sold to Juventus in 1970.</p><p>Unfortunately, his career with Juventus started on a bad note, as Fabio criticized the manager Armando Picchi the same day that Picchi revealed his cancer diagnosis. The club was not impressed and it resulted in him getting fined. However, after the poor start, Fabio produced stunning performances and had major success with the club.</p><p>While with Juventus, Fabio won the league title from 1972 to 1975, also helping his team reach the 1973 European Cup Final. Even with the success, the club was worried about Fabio’s injury and traded him to Milan.</p><p>He served as manager of Real Madrid, Roma, AC Milan, Juventus, England, and Russia. He became the manager of the Russian national team in 2012.

The team started well but it was not to last and after crushing defeat, Fabio was fired once again.</p><p>This was the last straw for Fabio, and following his firing, he decided to retire from coaching altogether.
