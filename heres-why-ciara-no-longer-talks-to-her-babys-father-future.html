When you the man, you wanna make certain decisions for yourself and she wanna make certain decisions,” he said.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicki Minaj’s Closest Hollywood Friends (& 5 Bridges She Burned)</a></span></p><p>“And I feel like the best route for me is to make more music, to go back to Atlanta and go back to my roots. Sometimes the lady don’t see what you see. That was a hard situation but at the end of the day it wasn’t about that. I called off [the engagement] long before any cheating rumors came out.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But Ciara begged to differ in her 2020 interview with Jada Pinkett Smith on Facebook Watch’s Red Table Talk, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealing that the relationship was toxic </a>and that she had endured a lot of pain during her romance with Future, which doesn’t sound like they simply ended the relationship because they grew apart, as the latter had put it in his conversation with HuffPost.</p><p>"I would have moments, I'd be in the shower, crying," she recalled in the days after having birth her son with Future. "I'd be crying because I am not in the happiest place and it hurts what I'm going through.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ciara And Monica Stopped Being Best Friends When This Happened</a></span></p><p>“The one thing I fear in life is wasting my life, wasting my time, I really fear that because you realize that time does not stop and it will be the worst scenario to stay in a situation that's just not healthy, not going to get any better. I realized I have to start making different decisions, period. Knowing what you don't want is really important. It creates clarity.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the same interview, the “1, 2 Step” chart-topper added that when she finally met Russell in 2015, there was a sense of calmness to her life.</p><p>Not only had the professional athlete accepted that Ciara already had a newborn child with another man, but he embraced it and considered Future Jr. as his own from the moment things had gotten serious between him and CiCi.</p><p>What’s interesting, though, is that the mother of three acknowledges that had she never experienced the ups and downs in her past relationship, she may have never ended up meeting Russell, to begin with.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ciara Celebrates Natalia Bryant’s 18th Birthday With A Dance, And Vanessa Loves It</a></span></p><p>It’s been revealed that Ciara and Future only communicate through the help of their lawyers these days. In December 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> reported that Ciara had sued her ex for $15 million for libel and slander, claiming in court documents that the latter had used their child in publicity stunts, such as the time he claimed CiCi was keeping him from seeing his son.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ciara had actually granted him 19 visitation rights at the time of the false claim.</p><p>“She just wants what’s best for her and her baby,” a source told the credible publication. “She is a really great mom. Baby Future is attached to her and a super smart kid. She’s really patient and loving with him.”</p><p>“He is jealous she has moved on and is happy. He is unable to move on and co-parent in a healthy way. Future has told her he hopes she fails in everything she does and that’s just being evil.”</p><p>Ciara now resides in Bellevue, Washington, which is just east of Seattle. The beautiful mansion cost Wilson a whopping $6.7 million and boasts 6.67 acres with 84 feet of high-bank waterfront.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmmqKZopZ6r7uMpaann5WnerWty6SqZqyfYrWmvoybmJuxo2KzosDHnqlmnqWpwrOxjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
