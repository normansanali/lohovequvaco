This also comes in 9 feet, 12 feet, and a slim version as well. It has over 2,200 color changing lights, including colored lights and a warm soft white. It comes with a battery operated remote, which makes it easy to glide through all 10 different light settings.”</p><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=248 data-injectable=false>@xosimplylo then proceeded to showcase all of the different light settings that the Grand Duchess Balsam Fir Christmas tree has to offer, admitting that the “twinkle white lights” are her favorite, and we seriously could not agree more.</p><p data-characters=104 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>She concluded passionately, “This took less than 10 minutes to put up. It is worth the buy.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=652 data-injectable=true><a title=@offliveoak href=#>@offliveoak</a><p>The FOMO I have on this viral Christmas tree is real yall!! <a title=homedepotchristmastree href=#>#homedepotchristmastree</a> <a title=viralchristmastree href=#>#viralchristmastree</a> <a title=christmastreeshopping href=#>#christmastreeshopping</a> <a title=grandduchesstree href=#>#grandduchesstree</a> <a title=t28 href=#>#t28</a> <a title=t30 href=#>#t30</a> <a title=christmastreeohchristmastree href=#>#christmastreeohchristmastree</a> <a title=fakechristmastree href=#>#fakechristmastree</a> <a title=artificialchristmastree href=#>#artificialchristmastree</a> <a title=eastcastlebalsamfir href=#>#eastcastlebalsamfir</a></p><a title="♬ Christmas standard song - 3KTrack" href=#>♬ Christmas standard song – 3KTrack</a></figure><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=142 data-injectable=false>While @xosimplylo believes that purchasing the Grand Duchess Balsam Fir Christmas tree is a must, not all TikTok users are in agreement…</p><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>@offliveoak had some critiques towards the product in a video of her own, suggesting a different Christmas tree from Home Depot instead called the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pre-Lit LED Eastcastle Balsam Fir Artificial Christmas tree</a>.</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true>“I’m going into Home Depot to look for the viral Christmas tree, and I was able to find it, but I’ve got some questions for y’all,” the TikTok user explained, before diving into the negatives she found surrounding the product.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>“I was kinda surprised, but I think the tree looks a little hole-y. Like, I can straight up see through the tree in some spots,” she dished, discovering that the Pre-Lit LED Eastcastle Balsam Fir Artificial Christmas tree appeared to be a lot fuller, even though it was lacking the “twinkle white lights” we know and love.</p><p data-characters=160 data-current-count=507 data-injectable=true>To follow this statement, @offliveoak continued with yet another problem that both Christmas trees had, which was the lack of diversity when it comes to height.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>“The trees either come in 7.5 feet or 9 feet tall. I have 9 foot ceilings, so I feel like I can’t get a 9 foot tall tree, because how will I fit my angel on top? But, the 7.5 foot tree looks so short,” she shared, detailing her dilemma to her nearly 500k followers.</p><p data-characters=135 data-current-count=418 data-injectable=true>Concluding the video by asking viewers which Christmas tree she should purchase, the TikTok user seemingly left the store empty-handed.</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>To check out the viral Christmas tree that TikTok users have been raving about, the Grand Duchess Balsam Fir Christmas tree, as well as the Pre-Lit LED Eastcastle Balsam Fir Artificial Christmas tree, are available to purchase at Home Depot now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8qsCMoqpmr5%2Bnwal506GcZpqlrnq1tMRmraKqkaF6tbXKraakZZOdv6q%2F06aYrGWkp7KmecSxp6WZmaOypXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
