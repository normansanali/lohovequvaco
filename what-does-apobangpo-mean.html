Recently, BTS member V took to Instagram to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reminisce on the group’s journey</a>, and he shared a video where he wrote a heartfelt message for their dedicated fanbase, also known as ARMY. In his message, V used the word ‘apobangpo,’ which had been frequently used by the members in the past. But what exactly does this intriguing word mean?</p><h2 id=h-the-meaning-of-apobangpo-explained data-injectable=false>The meaning of Apobangpo, explained</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=585 data-current-count=885 data-injectable=true>The term ‘apobangpo’ made its debut when BTS’ talented main vocalist, Jungkook, uttered it during a fancafe meeting with the dedicated fanbase. This unique word holds a special meaning as it represents the unwavering bond between the fans, known as ARMY, and the members of BTS. Meaning ‘ARMY Forever, Bangtan Forever,’ apobangpo beautifully encapsulates the love and loyalty that exist between the fans and the group. While some fans briefly used the abbreviation AFBF, it is the term ‘apobangpo’ that continues to resonate among the members.</p><p data-characters=538 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>During a recent live session, Jungkook playfully encouraged fans to share the word ‘Apobangpo’ in the comments, along with another beloved term, ‘borahae.’ The latter phrase, meaning ‘I purple you,’ holds deep significance after V unintentionally sparked the belief that purple is a color closely associated with BTS and their branding. Fans and members alike have embraced ‘borahae’ as a powerful expression of love and support for one another, creating a sense of unity within the fandom.</p><p data-characters=487 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=false>While numerous <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">words and phrases have emerged from the realm of K-Pop</a>, there are certain expressions that hold a special place in BTS’s heart, serving as a tribute to their profound connection with their fans and their unwavering affection for their fans. These words have become a part of the ARMY’s lexicon, and after 10 years accompanying this group that started from very humble beginnings, it is essential for every devoted fan to cherish and embrace these little terms.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46wn5qsXZm8pr%2BMmqeompGjtLG7jKacmqZf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
