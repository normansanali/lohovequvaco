The following year, he won the John von Neumann Theory Prize from the Operations Research Society of America (currently Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences, INFORMS) for his work upon contributing in the theory of three fields which include; portfolio theory; sparse matrix methods; and simulation language programming (SIMSCRIPT).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=harry-markowitz-modern-portfolio-theory-and-portfolio-selection></span><span>Harry Markowitz Modern Portfolio Theory and Portfolio Selection</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Modern portfolio theory (MPT) is a theory on how risk-averse investors can construct portfolios to optimize or maximize expected return based on a given level of market risk, emphasizing that risk is an inherent part of higher reward. According to the theory, it’s possible to construct an “efficient frontier” of optimal portfolios offering the maximum possible expected return for a given level of risk.</p><p>This theory was pioneered by Harry Markowitz in his paper “Portfolio Selection,” published in 1952 by the Journal of Finance. He was later awarded a Nobel prize for developing the MPT. Modern portfolio theory argues that an investment’s risk and return characteristics should not be viewed alone, but should be evaluated by how the investment affects the overall portfolio’s risk and return.</p><p>MPT shows that an investor can construct a portfolio of multiple assets that will maximize returns for a given level of risk. Likewise, given the desired level of expected return, an investor can construct a portfolio with the lowest possible risk. Based on statistical measures such as variance and correlation, an individual investment’s return is less important than how the investment behaves in the context of the entire portfolio.</p><p>MPT makes the assumption that investors are risk-averse, meaning they prefer a less risky portfolio to a riskier one for a given level of return. This implies that an investor will take on more risk only if he or she is expecting more rewards. The portfolio’s risk is a complicated function of the variances of each asset and the correlations of each pair of assets.</p><p>To calculate the risk of a four-asset portfolio, an investor needs each of the four assets’ variances and six correlation values, since there are six possible two-asset combinations with four assets. Because of the asset correlations, the total portfolio risk, or standard deviation, is lower than what would be calculated by a weighted sum.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=harry-markowitz-books></span><span>Harry Markowitz Books</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Some of his books include;</p><li>Risk-Return Analysis, Volume 2: The Theory and Practice of Rational Investing</li><li>Risk-Return Analysis Volume 3</li><li>Equity Valuation and Portfolio Management</li><li>The Theory and Practice of Investment Management Workbook: Step-by-Step Exercises and Tests to Help You, Master, The Theory and Practice of Investment Management</li><li>The Founders of Modern Finance: Their Prize-winning Concepts and 1990 Nobel Lectures</li><li>Mean-Variance Analysis in Portfolio Choice and Capital Markets</li><li>Portfolio Selection: Efficient Diversification of Investments</li><li>Risk-Return Analysis: the Theory and Practice of Rational Investing</li><li>Practical Financial Optimization: Decision Making for Financial Engineers</li><li>The Theory and Practice of Investment Management: Asset Allocation, Valuation, Portfolio Construction, and Strategies</li><li>A Practitioner’s Guide to Asset Allocation</li><li>The Flaw of Averages: Why We Underestimate Risk in the Face of Uncertainty</li><li>The Fundamental Index: A Better Way to Invest</li><li>Equity Management: Quantitative Analysis for Stock Selection</li><li>Modern Portfolio Theory: Foundations, Analysis, and New Developments Jack Clark Francis</li><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-harry-markowitz></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions about Harry Markowitz</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-harry-markowitz></span><span>Who is Harry Markowitz?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Harry Markowitz is an American award-winning Economist, Educator and Author.
