Martin Scorsese has little to prove as a filmmaker by this point, as he's been making classics since the early 1970s. He's turned out a masterpiece in just about every decade too,&nbsp;ranging from&nbsp;<a href=#>Raging Bull</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=#>Goodfellas</a> and 2019's <a href=#>The Irishman</a>.</p><p>That's just the tip of the iceberg, however, with one of his most acclaimed movies of recent years being 2013's&nbsp;<a href=#>The Wolf Of Wall Street</a>. Wolf Of Wall Street cast Leonardo DiCaprio as real-life New York stockbroker Jordan Belfort, with the movie charting his rise and fall in addition to his positively hedonistic lifestyle. The movie was both a critical and commercial smash, and alongside the praise DiCaprio received for this performance, the movie also boasted great work from Margot Robbie, Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughey.</p><p>For McConaughey, <a href=#>The Wolf Of Wall Street</a>&nbsp;came smack in the middle of a period dubbed The McConaissance. This found the actor on a string of great performances in the likes of <a href=#>The Dallas Buyers Club</a> and the first season of <a href=#>True Detective</a>. His role in Wolf Of Wall Street is a relatively small one and he plays Mark Hanna, a senior stockbroker who shows the ropes to Belfort early in the story. One of the most famous scenes has Hanna take Belfort out for lunch, where he performs a strange chant that involves thumping his chest and humming.</p><figure class=item-img></figure><p>It turns out this wasn't in the script either, and it's actually part of an acting ritual/relaxation technique Matthew McConaughey sometimes uses while getting ready to shoot scenes. He claims this helps him get out of his head prior to filming and he did this chant in front of DiCaprio while they were prepping the lunch scene. It was actually the latter who suggested to McConaughey and Scorsese as they were about&nbsp;to wrap the scene that maybe Hanna could do the chant during their conversation, so they quickly shot the character performing his ritual as musical bookends.</p><p>The Matthew McConaughey's <a href=#><strong>Wolf Of Wall Street</strong></a> chant soon became of the most iconic parts of the movie and is right up there in popularity with the actor's own "Alright, alright, alright" from Dazed And Confused. The movie also features the "One of Us" chant, which is a reference to the 1930s horror movie <a href=#>Freaks</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Every Cameo In The Wolf Of Wall Street</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirk6eyprrRmqWtZpOkunDDzqWdZq%2BRobluv9OrnJ6sXaK8t7XEZqSarKSdsrh5zJyaqKaRqrSpsdhmmqGZnql6sL7IoKCnZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
