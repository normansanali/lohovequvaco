Well-deserved. You killed it!!!</p>— All Wonky (@allwonky) <a href=#>May 23, 2024</a></figure><p>"I never expected to be back on Jeopardy!," Victoria confided. "I never expected the call for the Invitational Tournament. Once I got the call, I never expected to win it. I did not go into this expecting to win it. So to have done it felt really completely overwhelming. It was kind of like system collapse.”</p><p style=text-align:start>As for how the humble quiz master is celebrating her surprise victory, Victoria shared, "I told my husband to go to the wine store and buy the single silliest bottle of Champagne and go to the fancy cheese shop. So we had our very fancy wine and cheese when we got back."</p><p>And how did James react to his loss? The former champ had this to say on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> following Victoria's big win: "Huge congrats to Yogesh and especially Victoria for a brilliantly played final match. The trivia community and fans of <a href=#>The Chase</a> already knew <a href=#>Victoria is the best quizzer</a> in the country — now fans of Jeopardy! Masters know it too."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwedaopWailaS9or7DsmSmmaOpsrO%2FjGtna2w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
