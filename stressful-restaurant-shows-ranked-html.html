And her Sydney, a sous-chef at one of the most hectic, anxiety-inducing restaurants in Chicago, would know. But let’s take that a step further: It would be weird to work in a restaurant and then watch TV about people who work in a restaurant and not lose your mind. You could end up reliving some of your worst moments! You could be inviting stress in! We live in 2024. None of us need to be inviting extra stress in, my babies. And yet there are some really great shows about restaurant life that you just don’t want to miss.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxxdls21000q3b86doewttcf@published data-word-count=111>Your tolerance level for TV-induced stress is up to you, but to help you decide which scripted restaurant shows — or shows with a main character whose job at a restaurant is a main source of conflict for them — are on your desired level, scroll through our list, ranked from least stress-inducing to most stress-inducing, complete with a handy little antacid count so you know exactly the level of stomach churning these shows might evoke. In honor of The Bear season 3, we’ve even added five more series to our original list, because when it comes to restaurant TV shows, you can never have too many plates spinning.

In real life, sure, a small family-run burger place like Bob’s Burgers might be prone to give a person agita — the majority of the employees there are children, the health inspector is up the Belchers’ butts (you’re welcome, Tina), and the raccoon drama is overwhelming. But watching Bob’s Burgers, now, that is one of the most wonderful ways to pass the time. It’s silly and warm and the Belchers really care about one another. And even though there are hijinks and the restaurant seems like it is on the brink of closing every other week, everything works out in the end.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl5bet2wz001w3b6v6hg9i2r7@published data-word-count=22><strong>Antacid count:</strong> Zero needed.

Surely some of his problems came from letting his friends try to help both in the kitchen and with marketing to disastrous ends (both of those examples are referring to Max, by the way, so maybe Dave just had a Max problem). But he also brought some troubles on himself — creating a cocktail that makes all your friends have sex dreams about you is unfortunate, after all.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl5bexjcn003t3b6vs4vf52cd@published data-word-count=25><strong>Antacid count: </strong>This show is a wild, wacky balm, so zero antacids.

Sure, when small-town girl Tess arrives in New York City and promptly lands a job here with no experience simply because she called it “special” in her interview, she’s there for all of maybe one hour (she fills, what, one salt shaker?) before she almost has a panic attack, but after that Tess … mostly stares at people? There’s a lot of staring going on at this restaurant. Sure, there’s some stress in being reminded of how awkward it can be when you hook up with a co-worker and then have to work a shift with them, but overall the stakes here feel surprisingly low.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl5bf1vg4004f3b6vm0rcxz31@published data-word-count=16><strong>Antacid count: </strong>One, but only because Tess is really creeping me out with all the staring.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl5bf2qmp004u3b6vtww4sc79@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>10.</p></span>The Monster Foodies Truck Sketch on Sesame Street</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl5beroga00193b6v8h4th5qh@published data-word-count=128>Is Sesame Street mainly a stress-free watch and also meant for children? Sure, fine, yes to both of those questions. And yet still, any time I catch this Cookie Monster and Gonger sketch in which they take a kid’s food order, make that item in their food truck, and then launch it to the customer via catapult, I get a little twitchy. Neither of these guys is wearing hairnets and they are legit like 95 percent hair. They never have all the ingredients they need, so they are constantly having to drive out to different farms and factories and those excursions cost you valuable time in the kitchen. And do not get me started on the food-delivery mechanism these monsters (and I mean that on several levels!!) employ.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl5bf385700513b6vz9u6ty1j@published data-word-count=20><strong>Antacid count:</strong> Only two — despite their questionable culinary practices, these monsters are cute and have a catchy theme song.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clxxh1qyv00223b867i1he1mw@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>9.</p></span>Frank’s Place</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxxh5t7000283b862jckr30x@published data-word-count=108>Oh, you want to hear about stress? Let me tell you about Frank. This poor dude is stuck taking over his father’s — a father who left when Frank was 2 — New Orleans restaurant when one of the employees puts a voodoo spell over him. If he returns home, his life will basically blow up. Running a restaurant with the fear of a literal curse hanging over your head? Now that’s stress. But even though Frank, a professor from Boston, has absolutely no idea how to run a restaurant and this ’80s dramedy deals with some serious subject matter at times, it’s mostly uplifting in the end.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxxh63dt002e3b867kqdxel7@published data-word-count=26><strong>Antacid count: </strong>Two.

Honestly, the restaurant stuff is the most calming bit! Huo Ting En might run a tight ship, but he’s generally an understanding boss. When he throws a spoon at one of his line cooks, it’s more of a gentle toss tinged with disappointment. And when he and Wei Fen Qing spend time in the kitchen together, it’s less stress-inducing and more butterfly-inducing, you know? There is that one time he tries to get her to guess ten different curries she just tasted in 30 seconds, which really seems like he’s setting her up to lose. Other than that, though, the biggest stressor is just waiting for these two to work out their issues and run into each other’s arms. (Spoiler alert: They do!)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxxh9kve002v3b86xzh4n29m@published data-word-count=62><strong>Antacid count:</strong> Three and a half. Two because at its baseline, romance is stressful. One for that time Ting En and Fen Qing fall, like, seven stories off a rooftop (they’re fine). Half because initially it seems like Ting En is drawn to Fen Qing because she reminds him of his dead sister and that … that is unsettling. Still, yay love!</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl5bf9b47005n3b6vj8wrtqe0@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>5.</p></span>Chef!</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl5beros9001a3b6v0nwn2isd@published data-word-count=164>This mid-’90s BBC sitcom stars Lenny Henry as Gareth Blackstock, the chef de cuisine at an Oxfordshire two Michelin-starred French restaurant called Le Château Anglais. Literally one of his first lines in the entire series is “I’m Gareth Blackstock. I am seriously unpleasant. I am a bastard,” so, like, yes, this man is an asshole and proud of it. The show is a comedy and much of Gareth’s dressing down of his staff (and guests!) is played for laughs, but I think the laugh track might make it worse? Being berated by your boss for your incompetence and having a bunch of strangers laugh at you is true nightmare fuel. Eventually, thankfully, Gareth reveals himself to also be a bit of a goof who can’t bring himself to fire even his most inept employees — he just happens to be ultrapassionate about his work (his art!). He is so over the top about it that, eventually, you’ll be able to laugh about it, too.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl5bfa7mr00673b6vartuoicy@published data-word-count=42><strong>Antacid count: </strong>Was going to say five but will deduct one because when Blackstock yells at that guest who asks for salt without even tasting his dish first in episode two, that is both a hilarious and valid response to the situation.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clxxhcdj600303b86t25absnl@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>6.</p></span>Aftertaste</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxxhsj8t003g3b86kjqc2oeg@published data-word-count=143>Throughout Aftertaste’s two seasons, we watch disgraced Michelin-starred chef Easton West (yes, he gave himself the name) in a few different restaurants, and I wouldn’t exactly call this intensely stressful, but I would definitely call him a complete asshole. Easton’s massive ego might only be outmatched by his temper. While such a presence in the kitchen could make for a hellish working situation, it’s best to handle him the way his 19-year-old niece and genius pastry chef Diana does when the two go into business together and mostly ignore his antics (until they get super-personal, but that’s the trouble with making family your co-workers, I guess). The biggest stressors here are simply how much pressure both Easton and Diana put on themselves. Oh, and also the multiple corpses that may or may not be buried outside their pop-up restaurant — also quite stressful!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxxhtm2n003m3b86a9xd76yi@published data-word-count=66><strong>Antacid count: </strong>Four. Despite anything else going on, there’s just no way to be too stressed when you remember how Diana surprises Easton on opening night by switching out dessert from a crème brûlée to a chocolate and cream re-creation of a vagina, which she serves with no utensils. Watching a room full of diners realize how they’re supposed to eat that really soothes the soul.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl5bfe2d9006t3b6vyswo8nvm@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>5.</p></span>Oh My Ghost!

It’s like, you think you have enough to be stressed about when you’re working for an arrogant celebrity chef who you have a mortifyingly huge crush on because even though he is an ass he will do things like reach around you to physically show you how to cut onions properly, and then on top of that, you have to worry about a fucking ghost taking over your body?? And friends, I’m not using fucking for emphasis here, the ghost that possesses shy, unassuming kitchen assistant Bong-sun in this South Korean dramedy is the horniest ghost you’ve ever seen!

Thirio actually seems to run pretty smoothly considering things. Some of those things to be considered are as follows: the 10,000 story lines Feed the Beast needs to keep up, the absolutely batshit-crazy decision-making going on by every character; the fact that the big bad is a Polish mafia guy nicknamed the Tooth Fairy and he is the least-intimidating person with pliers you’ll ever see; the number of murders happening around this restaurant; the fluctuating levels of New York accent Sturgess will use in any given scene; and the bonkers cliffhanger it ends on.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxxi1lr9004d3b869azp98sv@published data-word-count=45><strong>Antacid count: </strong>Five because, seriously, Schwimmer didn’t get even one whiff of all that gas pouring into the restaurant before it explodes?
