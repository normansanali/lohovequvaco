He is not married again after his divorce from his previous wife,&nbsp;<span data-preserver-spaces=true>Oulèye Ndoye</span>.</p><p>It looks like Warnock has no plans to marry anytime soon as he is busy in the election and winning the post as a senator.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Raphael-Warnock-New-Wife-1024x576.webp><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Warnock’s previous wife, Oulèye Ndoye, was born in 1985 to a supportive family living in New York City, USA.&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Similarly, her parents belong of African-American descent.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Unfortunately, she has kept everything private about her parents and other family members.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, Warnoc’s ex-wife Ndoye completed her bachelor’s degree in international studies at Spelman College in 2007.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In addition, she pursued further studies at Oxford University. Ndoye completed her M.Sc. in migration and global development in 2013.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Furthermore, Ndoye’s dedication to education encouraged her to earn another master’s degree in history in 2015 at Columbia University in New York.</span></p><h2>Raphael Warnock’s Relationship With His Ex-Wife Oulèye Ndoye</h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Junior United States senator from Georgia, Raphael Warnock, tied the knot with his former wife, Oulèye Ndoye, on 14 February 2016.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Atlanta Ebenezer Baptist Church’s senior pastor Warnock proposed Ndoye in January 2016. Soon after his marriage proposal, the two decided to exchange their wedding vows in a vibrant open ceremony at the Historic MLK Church.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Warnock’s ex-wife Ndoye is a human right activist, and they might have further extended their relationship as Warnock is a known politician who could understand the activist’s work.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Besides, he served as</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;Georgia’s junior United States senator while dating&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ndoye.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She is single now after divorcing Warnock in November 2020.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The former pair separated in 2019, and subsequently, they divorced in 2020.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Warnock’s relationship with his ex-wife Ouleye ended on a sour note as she accused her ex that he ran over her foot in a dispute.&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Yes, multiple trusted media outlets recovered Police body-cam footage of the incident on December 2020.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Seeing the footage, Police officers were seen on the spot after Ndoye called them, and she accused Raphael of running over her foot. Clearly, the incident seemed like an accident or a rush moment than intentional.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Raphael-Warnock-ex-Wife-Ouleye-Ndoye-1024x538.png><p>Her report to the Police authorities seemed partially true, as&nbsp;<span data-preserver-spaces=true>Raphael</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;didn’t intentionally step on her foot. The politician was allegedly attempting to flee with their children.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>According to the concerned authorities, the pair quarreled in March as well. Also, a dispute was raised when Warnock denied their two kids visiting Ouleye’s family in Senegal.</span></p><h2>Raphael Warnock’s Family And Kids</h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The former couple, Raphael Warnock and Ouleye Ndoye are parents of two kids, Chloe and Caleb.</span></p><p>Also, Warnock and&nbsp;<span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ndoye reached an agreement while</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;he was running for the U.S. Senate in early 2020.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Similarly, Ndoye asked the judge to give her additional custody and child support payments for their two young children.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Moreover, following his victory,&nbsp;<span data-preserver-spaces=true>Warnock’s income saw a substantial increase. So, this must be the reason&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church retained him as its senior pastor after he joined his new office.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOsJ%2BoZZmoerOtz6GYnqRdrK6zus6comamlax6uLXFnmShmaNitaZ5zJqpq6GVmXqis8CipWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
