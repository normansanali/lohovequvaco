Back in 2017, Miller shocked one fan by planting a big smooch on his lips during a Comic Con encounter. According to <a href=#>TMZ</a>, the fan asked Miller if they had been drinking and asked to smell their breath. In response, Miller kissed him, garnering a shocked reaction.</p><p dir=ltr>But, while that encounter elicited a few gasps, Miller had a much more extreme encounter at a bar called Prikið Kaffihús in Reykjavik, Iceland. According to <a href=#>Variety</a>, the Hollywood star encountered a few "pushy" fans at the bar. Jokingly, a woman looked ready for a play fight with the celebrity. In response, Miller asked, "Did you want to fight?" before following up with a choke-slam to the ground. In video of the altercation, viewers can hear one person yell, "Whoa, bro!"</p><p>Based on the video alone, it's unknown if Miller had been doing a skit or not. But according to <a href=#>ET Canada</a>, the fight was all too real. In fact, the star ended up being escorted off the property as a result. Another bar patron claims that Miller spit on them and members of the staff, as well. Unfortunately for Miller, it wouldn't be the last time they appeared in the news for seemingly bad behavior in the company of fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcW9haIFye9OhnGaumaS5prrTZqCnm5mZsq%2FAjJ6xq5ldoratuMSrZKimk5p6qa3DZq6irJhirm6ywKdm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
