Artists just do this to get certifications for their album. I don't like it." The post was later removed, with the creator alleging that he "was not trying to start a stan war," prompting him to delete it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/10/07/620710_df182636ad02d67add6cef6e6395681c.jpg><p><h6>Phillip Faraone/Getty Images</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The post sparked a ton of debate online about what Cardi's intentions are – and if they even matter to anyone but her. Of course, once she got wind of the discourse, the "Thru Your Phone" artist didn't hesitate to join the chat. In response to Foster's explanation for his removal, she wrote, "Stop trying to act innocent when [you] know [you] was trying to pander."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Why haven't you said nothing about other [artists] who recently put songs [before] the pandemic on their album or people that have to put other [people's] songs on their shit... Imagine my biggest song not being on [an] album."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Speaking in the&nbsp;Hustlers star's defence, one user wrote, "I don't see anything wrong with it. The sophomore album was always supposed to be 'WAP' and 'Up''s home. Then she got pregnant and things got delayed. The songs are part of the work and not just random songs thrown on an album."&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In response, the&nbsp;Invasion of Privacy artist quote tweeted, "Lmaaaoooooooooo imagine me not putting my OWN records on my album."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Whether it's good or bad, guess whose album y'all gave promo to today FOR NO REASON?!" Cardi wrote in another post. "THANK YOU, girls! Now get your coins ready!"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Are you excited to hear the 29-year-old's sophomore album?
