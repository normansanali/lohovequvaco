She was also a doting grandmother, and her three grandchildren, who brought immense joy to her life, will miss her dearly.</p><p>She fought a courageous battle against a challenging medical condition, and even in her struggle, she continued to inspire us with her strength and resilience. At one point, a doctor expressed to me her surprise that she had stayed with us for this long, given her condition; I said, “If you knew my Mom, you wouldn’t be surprised.”</p><p>Your support throughout this journey has meant more than words can express. Your contributions, your messages of encouragement, and your presence in her life have made a difference and we are profoundly grateful for your kindness and generosity.</p><p>Thank you for being a part of my mother’s journey and for standing by us in both times of hope and moments of sorrow.
