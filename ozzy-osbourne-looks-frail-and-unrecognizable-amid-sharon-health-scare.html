He now uses <a href=#>the walking stick</a> for that reason.</p><p>Throughout the course of his life, Ozzy has dealt with alcohol and substance abuse issues, as well as hospitalization stints.</p><p>Since 2019, he has undergone several surgeries to fix his neck and back issues that stemmed from a home fall and an ATV accident 16 years prior. His last&nbsp;<a href=#>operation was in June</a> when he had pins removed and realigned in his neck and back.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The Prince of Darkness was out shopping at Erewhon getting a bit of help from an assistant as he wheels his shopping cart. <span class=credit>BACKGRID</span></figure><p>Determined to not let his health issues hold him back, the Black Sabbath frontman <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told People</a> in September that he <a href=#>still plans to hit the road</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13>“It’s where I belong,” Ozzy said about touring. “The relationship I have with my audience is the biggest love affair of my life.</p><p>“I am determined to get back on stage even if I have to be nailed to a board and wheeled on,” he added. “Survival is my legacy.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Ozzy Osbourne performed at halftime when the Los Angeles Rams took on the Buffalo Bills at LA’s SoFi Stadium on Sept. 8. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Ozzy is pictured on his way out of Erewhon Market following his visit Dec. 20. <span class=credit>BACKGRID</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Ozzy’s sighting comes days after his wife, Sharon, was hospitalized for a “non-life threatening” emergency. <span class=credit>BACKGRID</span></figure><p>Meanwhile, following her hospitalization, Sharon, 70, revealed that she was<a href=#> back home and “doing great”</a> in social media posts on Monday, though she has yet to publicly disclose the reason for her hospital stay.
