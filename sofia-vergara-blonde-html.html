With over 24 million followers waiting for the next update from the actress, it must be intimidating choosing what to share. Now, in a recent selfie, the star has decided to reveal that she’s back to being a gorgeous blond again.</p><p>See Sofia Vergara in the photo below.</p><p>The snapshot shows her with a clean face and offers a more intimate look at Sofia Vergara as an everyday person. Never one to miss the opportunity to get glammed up though, she soon shared another post. This time, she updated fans on her look for Oscar parties. Naturally, her fans were stunned at the sight of her newly blond hair and classic Hollywood glamor. Get a look at her dress for the big event below.</p><p>Sofia Vergara is well recognized for her looks, but she’s never been afraid to play around with her image. That’s more true than ever in her upcoming project, Griselda. The mini-series for Netflix has her playing an infamous real-life drug queenpin, Griselda Blanco. You can see a nearly unrecognizable <a href=#>photo</a> of her in the role in the picture below, which reveals Sofia Vergara with dark hair, and possibly some prosthetics changing up the shape of her face. With so much work to look different from herself on the new <a href=#>show</a>, perhaps going blond is one way Vergara is getting back to herself outside of filming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sofia-vergara-griselda-1642667593.jpeg><p>The new <a href=#>series </a>doesn’t have a release date yet. So far, all we have is this first look at Sofia Vergara as Griselda Blanco, and it’s enough to get us itching for a trailer. While we know that the biopic series will tell the life of the real-life drug queenpin, it’s anyone’s guess what events will be covered during the movie. The real-life inspiration behind the film had quite the grisly and notable life. She passed away in 2012 at the age of 69 after being shot by someone driving by on a motorcycle. This was notable, since the <a href=#>method</a> of her murder was one that she allegedly first came up with, eventually becoming something gangs used the world over. There are rumors that claim she murdered her three husbands, that she came away from impossible shootouts, and that she’s responsible for a great many crimes. Even in a mini-series, her life story may be a difficult one to tell.</p><p>Griselda is a departure from the most well-known of Sofia Vergara’s roles. She has previously starred in the sitcom Modern Family as Gloria Delgado-Pritchett, a quotable and fan-favorite character. She starred alongside Reese Witherspoon in the comedy Hot Pursuit. While many try to narrow Vergara down as just a pretty face, she’s also worked in several voice roles for projects like The Emoji Movie, The Smurfs, and episodes of shows like Family Guy and The Simpsons. It seems like Sofia Vergara loves taking on a variety of roles and finding ways to show off her skillset as an entertainer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tno6Szqq2Mr5yrn5Gnrm6uy6ilnZ1encGuuA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
