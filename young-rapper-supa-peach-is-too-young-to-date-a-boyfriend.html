She is famous for her alias as Supa Peach which originated after her real name, Peachez and Supa since whenever she did anything, she “killed it.” She had interests in singing since a very young age and started to perform in birthdays and parties ever since she was ten years old. After ‘The Rap Game’ even when she did not win, she opened up to new opportunities.&nbsp;As of 2017, she is 14 years of age, standing 5 feet tall and her current net worth spanning around an estimated 100,000 dollars.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BWBEJFyH7Wz/?taken-by=_supapeach</p><p>Her dark skin complexion and curly hair might get her mistaken for a person with African-American ethnicity, but in fact, she is part Hispanic and part Pacific Islander regarding ethnicity and has even grown up in Puerto Rico.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7jIr5yuqJSWwaZ6wqikaLGfqruoedGap6mdomLAtrzAZqeemZOdeqq%2FjK2mqGWppMKvs4ytpmackamybq2Mm6aynqKesq%2Bwjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
