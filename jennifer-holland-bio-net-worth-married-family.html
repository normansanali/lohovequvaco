According to Jennifer, that was the day James asked her to go steady with him.</p><p>The couple met through actor Michael Rosenbaum who was dating a friend of Jennifer‚Äôs at the time and had offered to set them up after James saw a photo of her that Rosenbaum had. (Of course) Jennifer also mentioned falling in love at someone else‚Äôs wedding just as characters in a rom-com. While James, when talking about his version of meeting Jennifer has said For me, meeting Jennifer Holland was like seeing a color I had never seen before.‚Äù</p><p>Over the years, Jennifer, as well as James, have not shied about sharing glimpses from their life together on social media.</p><p>‚Äú#HappyValentinesDay to my valentine, who has been with me through the good times, the bad times, & now the great times!
