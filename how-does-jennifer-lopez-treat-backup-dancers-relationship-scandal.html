In the early 2000s, she fell in love with Cris Judd, a choreographer, and dancer, and they tied the knot in 2001. However, their marriage didn't last long, and they divorced in 2003.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/th-image-template-13.jpg><p>Lopez and Judd initially met on the set of her music video, "Love Don't Cost a Thing," which he directed. Judd revealed that it was love at first sight for him, "So, when Jennifer walks in, I shake her hand, and we kinda look at each other—and in my head, I’m like, 'Oh my God, I’m going to marry this woman,'" he revealed on an episode of Oprah.</p><p>However, the challenges that come with fame and the invasion of privacy proved to be difficult for him to handle, leading to the eventual end of their marriage. "Your privacy is breached. You're no longer a normal person. Unfortunately, it just didn't work out." Judd told US Weekly in 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-lopez-dated-her-backup-dancer-casper-smart>Jennifer Lopez Dated Her Backup Dancer, Casper Smart</h2><p>Jennifer Lopez and Casper Smart's love story began during her tour, where he worked as a backup dancer. Their on-again, off-again relationship lasted nearly five years before officially ending in 2016. Despite a significant age difference of 18 years, they found an undeniable connection.</p><p>Smart admitted that it started with innocent flirting but quickly blossomed into something more meaningful. They spent a whole year together, cherishing each other's company.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jennifer-lopez-s-assistant-quit-and-worked-for-mariah-carey-instead-because-of-her-hatred-towards-j-lo-s-ex-casper-smart.jpg><p>"I was single, she was single.

Neither of us thought it would be more than a fun time, and suddenly we were spending time together, we enjoyed each other's company, there was chemistry," he said in an interview with Univision.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They initially met in 2011, and their romance thrived for two years, making appearances together at events and award shows. However, in 2014, they unexpectedly parted ways for reasons unknown. Yet, fate seemed to bring them back together, as they were seen vacationing in the Hamptons and celebrating Jennifer's 46th birthday shortly after their breakup.</p><p>According to Page Six, Smart insisted that their relationship had remained professional for a long time before they couldn't resist the chemistry between them. Even though they seem committed to each other, they faced challenges, including allegations of Smart's involvement with two models and cheating with JLo. Despite briefly rekindling their romance in 2015, they eventually decided to call it quits for good in 2016.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-lopez-allegedly-dismissed-her-potential-backup-dancers-who-are-virgos>Jennifer Lopez Allegedly Dismissed Her Potential Backup Dancers Who Are Virgos</h2><p>According to Billboard, Jennifer Lopez held a dance audition in 2022 for her tour and reportedly cut potential dancers based on their astrological signs. During the Just Sayin' With Justin Martindale podcast, Glee star Heather Morris shared the story she heard from others.</p><p>According to Morris, JLo allegedly asked the auditioning dancers to raise their hands if they were Virgos. "She walks in the room, and she said, 'Thank you so much, you guys have worked so hard. By a show of hands if there are any Virgos in the room, can you just raise your hand?'" Those who identified as Virgos were thanked for their effort and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had to leave after a full day of auditions</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jennifer-lopez-was-slammed-for-a-false-skincare-ad-after-her-instagram-filter-glitched.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the host of the podcast asked if the story was true, Morris noted, "This is hearsay but true. When one person says something, could be true but when multiple people say something … it’s like, 'Oh, that happened.'"</p><p>Morris also admitted that she might have botched the story, and it could have been a different astrological sign that JLo dismissed. However, the tale speaks to the belief that Virgos prefer things planned and neat, while JLo enjoys a bit of chaos in her life.</p><p>Although there is no official confirmation of whether this rumor is true or not, it's interesting to note that Lopez's ex-husband, Marc Anthony, is a Virgo, while her new husband, Ben Affleck, is a Leo.</p><h2 id=jennifer-lopez-39-s-high-energy-dance-performances-left-some-of-her-dancers-feeling-sick>Jennifer Lopez's High-Energy Dance Performances Left Some Of Her Dancers Feeling Sick</h2><p>During an interview with E!
