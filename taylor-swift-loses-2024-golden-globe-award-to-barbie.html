Variety reported that she was one of the first people in the crowd to stand.</p><p>Aside from Barbie, Swift was up against Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, John Wick: Chapter 4, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part 1, Oppenheimer, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and The Super Mario Bros. Movie. 2024 marked the first-ever year this category was included at the Golden Globes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Taylor-Swift-winsLoses-860.jpg><p>Swift’s <a href=#>Eras Tour</a>, and its subsequent concert movie, made her one of the biggest stars of 2023. The film, which premiered in October of last year, has since become the second highest-grossing concert movie of all time, making $250.3 million worldwide. (Michael Jackson’s 2009 movie This Is It currently holds the record.)</p><p>Earlier in the night, the cameras kept panning to Swift, who sat at the same table as BFFs <strong>Keleigh Teller</strong> and <strong>Emma Stone</strong>. During the evening, she was caught catching up with her other bestie <strong>Selena Gomez</strong>. Most noticeably, Swift sipped her drink when Golden Globes host <a href=#><strong>Jo Koy</strong> joked about</a> her relationship with NFL star <strong>Travis Kelce</strong> during his opening monologue.</p><p>“The big difference between the Golden Globes and the NFL? At the Golden Globes, we have fewer camera shots of Taylor Swift. I swear,” Koy joked. “There’s just more to go to.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Taylor-Swift-winsLoses-861.jpg><p>Swift attended the awards show sans Kelce, 34, whose team, the Kansas City Chiefs, played at <a href=#>SoFi Stadium earlier</a> on Sunday. The team played their final regular season game against the Los Angeles Chargers and won 13 to 12. (Kelce didn’t play as the team sat several starters to prepare for the playoffs.)</p><p>This year wasn’t the first year that Swift was <a href=#>nominated for a Golden Globe</a>. She was up for the Best Original Song category in 2020 for her song “Beautiful Ghosts” from Cats, the musical movie in which she also starred.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I woke up today to the news that ‘Beautiful Ghosts’ is nominated for a Golden Globe,” Swift shared via Instagram in December 2019, after the nominations were announced. “It’s so cool that one of the most fun, fulfilling creative experiences I’ve ever had is being honored in this way by the HFPA.”</p><p>She lost to <strong>Diane Warren</strong>, <strong>Laura Pausini</strong> and <strong>Niccolò Agliardi</strong> for “Io sì (Seen)” from The Life Ahead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6xdoby0sdJmaWlqZGK0sLjDnqVmn5ykr6Z5wLCYq5xdqbxursCrmaKdXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
