As soon as she cries, Luiza will pick her up, whereas I could wait a little bit longer. But I think that’s a good balance to have with parents.”</p><p>Us broke the news in June that the pair, <a href=#>who met in August 2018</a>, welcomed a baby girl. “Luiza and I are so excited to announce that our beautiful baby girl, Rose, is finally here,” the Connecticut native told Us at the time. “It hasn’t been easy to keep such wonderful news under wraps, but it has always been my dream to become a father and I can’t wait for this next chapter!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Season 8 of Million Dollar Listing New York airs on August 1 at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Us-Weekly-Issue-2919-Cover.jpg alt=Us-Weekly-Issue-2919-Cover width=1000 height=1355 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>For more on the couple’s journey through parenthood, take a look at the gallery below and check out this week’s issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now!</p><p>With reporting by Marc Lupo</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkuqq4y6Kmp2WUpLmtrdFmqqahnJp6rrHErWSsrJWrsm6zzqWbZqSlnseiecaarqWnp6i4or%2BMm5ibsV2ctrO4jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
