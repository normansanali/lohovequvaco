That final match ended up being Tetsuya Naito vs. Kazuchika Okada, a culmination of like six years of storytelling involving Naito striving for a WK main event victory, and Naito has held the title since. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Naito has only been able to defend the title once in his reign, against KENTA in February 2020.</p><h2 id=hirooki-goto-147-days><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Hirooki Goto (147 Days)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Hirooki-Goto.jpg><p>The always-underrated samurai dad Hirooki Goto is a two-time IWGP Intercontinental Champion, and this 147-day reign is his second title run, which he won from Shinsuke Nakamura at Wrestling Dontaku in 2015. Unfortunately, Goto has the misfortune of being sandwiched between Nakamura IC title runs, so he ends up getting overshadowed by the King of Strong Style. To make matters worse, Goto’s only successful title defense in this reign was also against Nakamura, so he didn’t have much opportunity to really do much with the title this time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mvp-148-days><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>MVP (148 Days)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IC-MVP-Cropped.jpg><p>Montell Vontavious Porter&nbsp;— undervalued WWE guy and head of the Beat Down Clan&nbsp;— has the distinction of being the first IWGP Intercontinental Champ, having beaten Toru Yano in a tournament final in some 2011 USA shows co-promoted with Jersey All Pro Wrestling.

This first IC Title run is longer and more successful than first one, lasting about five months as he was able to defend the title against Yujiro Takahashi and Tomohiro Ishii. Goto ended up losing the title at July’s Kizuna Road to his CHAOS stablemate Shinsuke Nakamura, in what would be Nak’s landmark first title reign.</p><h2 id=shinsuke-nakamura-168-days><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Shinsuke Nakamura (168 Days)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IC-Shinsuke-Nakamura-Cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If there’s anyone responsible for elevating the IWGP Intercontinental Championship to main event status, it’s Shinsuke Nakamura, a former three-time IWGP Champ who’d reinvented himself as the cool and weird King of Strong Style. This is the title run where he won the strap back from La Sombra and got into a feud with Tanahashi that resulted in fans voting to put their title match at the top of the Wrestle Kingdom 8 card, which in turn sparked Tetsuya Naito’s aforementioned six-year quest for a main event victory.</p><h2 id=chris-jericho-209-days><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Chris Jericho (209 Days)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jerichonp-Cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At 2018’s New Years Dash!!, Chris Jericho attacked Tetsuya Naito, kicking off a year-long feud that would result in Jericho winning the title at Dominion half a year later. His first defense of the title would come five months later, as he’d tap out&nbsp;Evil with the Liontamer but hold it for two long, causing Evil’s LIJ buddy Naito to come out and successfully challenge for his old title at Wrestle Kingdom 13. Not a “fighting champion” kind of title reign, but a really long one where a heel held the title hostage from the hero.</p><h2 id=shinsuke-nakamura-224-days><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Shinsuke Nakamura (224 Days)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nakamura-ibushi-kick.jpg><p>Shinsuke Nakamura lost his IC strap to Bad Luck Fale in 2014, but ended up winning it right back on Fale’s first defense for a nice, lengthy reign as champ where he ran through Katsuyori Shibata and Yuji Nagata before losing the title to Hiroki Goto.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>NJPW: The 5 Best (& 5 Most Disappointing) IWGP Intercontinental Title Matches</a></span></p><p>Nak’s best match during this era, however, was his 2015 Wrestle Kingdom 9 title defense against Kota Ibushi, recently moved up from the Junior Heavyweight division. It’s a brutal match as Ibushi goes toe-to-toe with one of his idols, and one of Nakamura’s best efforts before signing with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WWE</a> the following year.</p><h2 id=hiroshi-tanahashi-230-days><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Hiroshi Tanahashi (230 Days)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hiroshi-tanahashi.jpg><p>The Ace of NJPW’s first IC Title reign in 2014 (92 days) mostly had Tanahashi feuding with Shinsuke Nakamura after winning the belt from him at Wrestle Kingdom 8, but this second reign (from 2017-2018) is much longer and full of diverse title defenses. He beat Naito for the title at Dominion and ran through a host of talent that included Kota Ibushi, Zack Sabre Jr., Jay White at the Tokyo Dome, and, randomly, Billy Gunn. Tana would end up dropping the title to Minoru Suzuki, which is pretty awesome.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tetsuya-naito-259-days><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Tetsuya Naito (259 Days)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Tetsuya-Naito.jpg><p>Naito may be the only other NJPW star who’s come close to defining the Intercontinental Championship, partially because of his fraught relationship with it. As established, Nakamura/Tanahashi WK8 IC title match bumped Naito’s IWGP Heavy match from the main event slot, so when he first won the title in 2016, he constantly tried to destroy the belt. He’d win it a few times over the years, but often regarded it as a curse that he could not dispel, but he also kind of wanted it?</p><h2 id=shinsuke-nakamura-313-days><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Shinsuke Nakamura (313 Days)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/PSX_20200503_154334.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Shinsuke Nakamura’s</a> first IC title reign was not only his longest, but the longest in history, running nearly a year after he won it from Hiroki Goto. It was during this time that the IC title became truly international, as Nak not only defended it against Western talent like Shelton Benjamin, Lance Archery, and Davey Boy Smith Jr., but also had title bouts in the US and Mexico. In Mexico, La Sombra untreated Nakamura for a spell, but Nakamura won it back. If it weren’t for that short intermission, Shinsuke Nakamura’s longest Intercontinental Title run would have been even longer.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>NJPW: The 10 Longest-Reigning IWGP Heavyweight Champions</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenp7K0wMuipaBnnp%2B9uHnIsJ6pZZmjwaa%2BwqilraGemru1rctmmqGZnaW2sLrSZqOoppeawLV50Z6goKajZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
