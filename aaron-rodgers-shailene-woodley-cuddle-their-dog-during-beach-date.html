He also shouted out his “fiancée” while offering thanks to those who’ve supported him throughout his time in the NFL.</p><p>Later that same month, the environmentalist<a href=#> confirmed the engagement</a> during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. She subtly showed off her massive engagement ring at the time.</p><p>“We met during this whacky, whacky time and all the stadiums were closed that he was playing in. I didn’t really grow up with sports, especially American sports. It was never really on my radar,” the California native said during the February 22 episode.&nbsp;“When we met, also, I knew he was a football guy, but I didn’t know like what kind of a football guy he was. And I’m still constantly learning.”</p><p>Though the pair may not have much in common professionally, <a href=#>it’s obvious to those close to them that they’re a great match</a>.</p><p>“They’re both hardworking, career-focused, have a similar lifestyle and are down&nbsp;to&nbsp;earth,” a source told Us exclusively earlier this month. “Aaron wouldn’t have proposed if he wasn’t 100 percent serious about Shailene&nbsp;being The One. … They’re a private couple and for the most part, they keep details of their relationship private.”</p><p>Still, the couple have offered fans a few glimpses into their <a href=#>life together</a>. On Monday, April 5, the Fault in Our Stars actress <a href=#>shared a live video</a> with her future husband via Instagram Stories.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In the video, Woodley kept referring to the Green Bay Packer as her “love.” She also commented on the pair’s dog, who’s become a fixture during their public appearances.</p><p>“Who else gets in fights with their partners about how much they get to cuddle with their dog?” Woodley asked. “Is it just us?”</p><p>Rodgers <a href=#>previously dated</a>&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Danica Patrick</strong></a> from December 2017 to&nbsp;July 2020&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Olivia Munn</strong></a> from May 2014 to April 2017. Woodley, for her part, began dating rugby player <a href=#><strong>Ben Volavola</strong></a>&nbsp;in 2017.
