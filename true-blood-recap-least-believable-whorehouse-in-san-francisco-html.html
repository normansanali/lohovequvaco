I feel like a lot of us would like to be a fly on the wall were it possible to see Nina Simone react to this episode, maybe in her later years, maybe after a couple of bottles of wine. I don’t know, just saying.&nbsp;</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-04892d006351472834f5a1887bbda583-3-0-1@published data-word-count=61>This week, Bill and Eric struck a deal with the Authority. Alcide found out that Sookie murdered his girlfriend and was kind of okay with it. Tara tried to kill herself, albeit unsuccessfully. Bill tried to tell her that it’s a natural urge, probably because we’re only watching the muffin batter full body makeup on the show, and he’s living it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-04892d006351472834f5a1887bbda583-3-0-2@published data-word-count=72>There was a lot of plot in which not a whole bunch happened, as is custom, and the usual smattering of “Okay, True Blood moments.” Many jokes were made at the expense of iPhones, texting, and Facebook, so in some small, nice way, it’s like Andy Rooney never met the “true death.” Here’s our rundown of what we found ludicrous in this visit to Bon Temps, ordered from least to most ridiculous.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-04892d006351472834f5a1887bbda583-4-0-0@published data-word-count=33><strong>Boobs Boobs Boobs Boobs</strong><br>Hah. Remember when Sookie read Sam’s thoughts and he said what we were all thinking? This was actually the most believable part of the episode, or any episode, for me.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-04892d006351472834f5a1887bbda583-5-0-0@published data-word-count=42><strong>Lafayette’s Demon</strong><br>Nothing says evil like sabotaging somebody’s soup. Who wears this look better, do you think? The Brujo monster, or Howie Mandel in Little Monsters? It’s the same makeup, right? Am I right? It’s a real Minka Kelly–Leighton Meester kind of thing.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-04892d006351472834f5a1887bbda583-6-0-0@published data-word-count=30><strong>Sookie’s HADOUKEN!

Also, just because you CAN make a flexible Asian prostitute joke doesn’t mean you should, HBO.

I don’t need to know why Jason has so much sex, television show. Jason has lots of sex because he is very attractive, and he is on an HBO television program.
