But, <strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Mariah Carey</a></strong> is not most people. Back in 2016, she reportedly charged her ex-fiancé <strong>James Packer</strong> a $50 million "inconvenience fee" when they broke up.

They were introduced by <strong>Brett Ratner</strong>, the movie producer and friend of Packer's who directed the film. The couple made their relationship public in 2015, and in January 2016, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>they became engaged</a> after Packer proposed with a 35-carat engagement ring.</p><p>"It's so heavy I can't lift my arm up!" Carey told E! News of the diamond. "No… It's a nice chunk." She said of her relationship, "I'm feeling fantastic, better than ever … He's an exceptional person and really… it gets more romantic by the day, so it's very sweet." She added that if the planning went well, the wedding would be "somewhat soon."</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Hugh Grant Blamed Cheating on Elizabeth Hurley on One of His Roles</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/mariah-james-.jpg><p>Packer and Carey's split was reported in October 2016. A representative for the singer told Entertainment Tonight that <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>they had not seen each other</a> since getting into a fight during a trip to Greece the previous month. Sources and representatives for both Carey and Packer then exchanged varying stories in the press.</p><p>For example, as reported by People, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>a source who was close to Carey</a> said at one point that Packer had "not been in a mentally healthy place." A source close to Packer then said, it was "typical Mariah to just twist things that don't sound good to her. They split because she has issues."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/mariah-2017.jpg><p>Entertainment Tonight reported in November 2016 that <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Carey requested a $50 million "</a><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>inconvenience fee"</a> from Packer for the engagement being called off. Reportedly, they had been discussing a prenup for if they had gotten married, which is where the $50 million amount came from. But, another source said "that figure never existed."<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>"He moved her across the country and relocated her and her kids," a source said. "He made promises to her that weren't fulfilled." This source also said that Carey wanted to keep her engagement ring—which was said to have been worth $10 million—and wanted Packer to buy her a home in California.</p><p>The source continued, "Mariah would like James to apologize for breaking up with her so publicly. She feels like he used her to increase his profile in America and globally to help further his business interests."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/mariah-james.jpg><p>A year later, in November 2017,&nbsp;ET reported that Carey had received a "<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>multimillion-dollar settlement</a>" from Packer in regards to their breakup. A source said, "She still has the ring and wears it now on her middle finger … They 100 percent have not spoken for a year, maybe even longer than that."</p><p>The Blast reported that <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Carey received between $5 million and $10 million</a> "between the cash and the ring," because the ring was reportedly not worth as much as the $10 million that had been previously reported.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Cher's "Demanding" Libido Is "Wearing Out" 37-Year-Old Boyfriend, Source Says</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/mariah-james-2.jpg><p>In 2020, Packer spoke to&nbsp;The Sydney Morning Herald <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>about his relationship with Carey</a> ahead of the release of her memoir, The Meaning of Mariah Carey. The businessman said, "I wish her well" and noted that they hadn't spoken for four years.</p><p>"She was kind, exciting and fun," Packer said. "Mariah is a woman of substance. She is very bright. But it was a mistake for her and a mistake for me."</p><p>Carey spoke about her memoir to&nbsp;The Guardian and was asked about the fact that <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>she didn't include Packer</a> in the book while she did write about her other relationships.</p><p>"If it was a relationship that mattered, it's in the book. If not, it didn't occur," she said. When the interviewer pointed out that she was engaged to Packer, and the star replied, "We didn't have a physical relationship, to be honest with you," and left it at that.</p><p class=p1><strong>For more celebrity news delivered right to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmppminq6pecKaqZ6xXZ%2BurrHSZqeam5uav26yxJ5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
