“Blurry pic of how to hang out 6 feet apart,” Dane, 47, captioned a photo of himself with his former costar, 54, on Thursday, April 30. Dempsey stood a solid distance behind the Euphoria star, who gave the camera a big thumbs up."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

McSteamy) on the beloved ABC series from 2006 to 2012. When it was announced that <a href=#>he would not be returning to the show</a> for season 9, Dane told <a href=#>TV Line</a> that he was “extremely grateful” for his Grey’s Anatomy family. “It has been wonderful to work alongside and learn from a creative force such as <a href=#><strong>Shonda Rhimes</strong></a>,” he said of the show’s creator.</p><p>Three years later, Dempsey’s Derek Shepherd (lovingly known as McDreamy) made his final appearance on the show after 11 seasons.

You need that time to <a href=#>figure out who you are</a> without the show.”</p><p>Despite Dempsey’s unexpected exit from Grey’s Anatomy, Pompeo reassured fans of the series that <a href=#>she would “always have a place” in her heart</a> for her former costar.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagqpWuwG6tzZqrqKWpqHqmvsicZJ2Znpp6sa3Tq6Cco12Zsq680p6wZqqVqruqwMRmbWaelZrBbq3PmqmtZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
