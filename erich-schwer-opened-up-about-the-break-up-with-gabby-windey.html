On November 15, 2022, Erich of Bachelor Nation came to Instagram Stories to confront his split with his ex-fiancée. He stated:</p><p>“Many of you have contacted me with inquiries regarding Gabby and myself. The fact is that we were never each other’s [sic] people – it’s difficult to pinpoint when there’s nothing to point to.”</p><p>He went on to say:</p><p>“We met in a really unusual scenario and method, and I’m pleased we did.” “I’d never take it back.”</p><p>On season 19 of The Bachelorette, Erich and Gabby met and became engaged. However, in the season finale, the pair called it quits less than two months after becoming engaged.</p><h2>Erich Schwer, the Bachelorette, hopes ex-fiance Gabby “gives them hell in the DWTS finals.”</h2><p>Despite their traumatic separation, Erich feels no ill will toward Gabby since she is a “wonderful person,” and he will always cheer for her. He stated:</p><p>“I hope she wrecks them in the DWTS finals.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Erich-Schwer.jpg alt="Erich Schwer" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He even said that after the split, he utilizes his “experiences and failures” to better himself on a daily basis.&nbsp;Gabby, the former Bachelorette, spoke up about her divorce from Erich on Monday’s episode of DWTS, explaining why things didn’t work out between the two. She stated:</p><p>“[Love] occupies a particular place in my heart since I just went through a breakup.” Our relationship ended because we weren’t entirely in sync with each other on our mutual objectives or the way we approached life. We weren’t the ideal fit for each other.”</p><h2>Erich and Gabby got engaged On The Bachelorette.</h2><p>Erich and Gabby originally met during season 19 of The Bachelorette. Gabby fought hard to find love on Clayton Echard’s season of The Bachelor before participating in The Bachelorette but was disappointed in the end.&nbsp;Gabby was certain that she would meet her ideal boyfriend on The Bachelorette. Gabby had her heart set on Erich, a real estate expert, after meeting a slew of possible suitors on the dating program.</p><p>Erich acknowledged his emotions to Gabby and proposed to her during the two-part September 20 show, claiming he is “head over heels in love” with her and “wants to spend the rest” of his life with her. Gabby accepted the proposal, and the couple got engaged on the air. Erich originally supported Gabby on DWTS on multiple times. Gabby was spotted abandoning her engagement ring for multiple tapings of the dance program shortly after, implying their split.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Erich-Schwer-1.jpg alt="Erich Schwer" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Even before they split up, the former couple had been through a lot of ups and downs. During their relationship, Erich was chastised for wearing blackface in his high school yearbook. He eventually apologized for his previous acts, but it harmed his relationship with Gabby. Soon after, Erich was himself in further controversy when his ex revealed text conversations in which he claimed he broke up with her in order to be on The Bachelorette.&nbsp;The ex-couple has finally spoken out about their split.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGicq6GTnXq0r8ewnKtln6Wyr7HDZqypZZGXvLbAjK2fnmWSp7Kit4yup2avmam1brPAm5myZaeeu6Wx2Gg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
