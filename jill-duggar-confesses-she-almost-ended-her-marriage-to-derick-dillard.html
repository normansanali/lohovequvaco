I'd be like, 'I hear you, I feel you, I also don't want to do whatever it is they're asking us to do either. But we have to.'"</p><p id=eBvuVkD-Hpa data-wc=30>When the couple tied the knot in 2014, they both envisioned carving a life separate from the show's omnipresent cameras. Yet, Jill shared: "It began to feel like a burden."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c407da8f153b-jill-derick.jpg><p id=eiuDAppA4kg data-wc=36>Given the tenets of their ultra-Christian upbringing, Jill was conditioned to never defy her father, further complicating matters. The 20 hours a week dedicated to filming became a contentious point, taking a toll on their relationship.</p><p id=egbvvVNokZN data-wc=31>"It definitely got between us," Jill stated. Their religion emphasized unwavering obedience to parents, even requiring their blessings for pivotal life decisions, such as purchasing a house or pursuing higher education.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a309f04a015d-jill-duggar-husband-family-d.jpg><p id=en1BltIfqGj data-wc=29>&nbsp;"We were dealing with this a lot when we were trying to make decisions for our family, and we were really wrestling back and forth with it," she added.</p><p id=entVZQu3npI data-wc=23>Yet, the conflict didn't end there. Whenever disagreements regarding the show arose, Jill's father was purportedly keen on intervening, further straining their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p id=etdiS4w1Qoy data-wc=27>Derick mentioned: "Whenever we were at odds with what her dad thought we should be doing with filming, he would say things that would be very damaging."&nbsp;</p><p id=ePoWKnD1XwL data-wc=25>Allegedly, Jim Bob would question Derick's intentions and his role in the discord, prompting Derick to state, "And I think that was a red flag."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/791c475fad1c-countingthecost.jpg><p id=eOgqQHsGdzq data-wc=59>The couple's candid revelations contrast starkly with her parent's stance. In a statement to the magazine, they expressed: "We love all of our children very much... We do not believe the best way to resolve conflicts, facilitate forgiveness and reconciliation, or to communicate through difficulties is through the media or in a public forum so we will not comment."</p><p id=euLdYwfuiX9 data-wc=29>The primary motivation behind Jill's decision to share her story, she reveals, is to support her siblings. She acknowledges that some might critique her decision, but she remains resolute.&nbsp;</p><p id=eKVDbCXVFk4 data-wc=43>"I know there will be nay-sayers, but I feel called to do this," Jill states. "We really wanted to tell our story for my siblings, because some of them are going to face similar challenges, if they haven't already, to what I've faced."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
