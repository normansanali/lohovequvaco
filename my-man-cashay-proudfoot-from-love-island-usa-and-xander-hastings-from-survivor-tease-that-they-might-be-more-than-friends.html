Although she won her first elimination challenge, the New York native found herself packing her bags after losing her second elimination challenge to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Survivor</a> legend <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sarah Lacina</a>, ultimately leading to Cashay Proudfoot‚Äôs untimely exit in episode 9.</p><p data-characters=742 data-current-count=742 data-injectable=true>As for Xander Hastings, the Chicago native came in third place on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Survivor 41</a>, falling short to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Erika Casupanan</a> and Deshawn Radden in a 7-1-0 vote.
