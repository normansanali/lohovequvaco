“My baby. Good luck today,” Tran, 25, captioned a snap of the couple prior to the awards show. In it, she has an arm around Brown, 24, who sits on the steps of a trailer, leaning into her shoulder."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Good luck today,” Tran, 25, <a href=#>captioned a snap of the couple</a> prior to the awards show. In it, she has an arm around Brown, 24, who sits on the steps of a trailer, leaning into her shoulder.</p><p>Though neither Tran nor Brown have publicly commented on the status of their relationship, the pair have been getting increasingly close since Brown and <a href=#><strong>Rihanna</strong></a> pulled the plug on their own volatile relationship back in early May.</p><p>“Imma do it solo,” he said of Rihanna in a radio interview with Australian radio show The Kyle and Jackie Show at the time. “I mean, at the end of the day, shawty doing her own thang, she on the road. It’s always gonna be love. I’m a grown man, just gotta fast forward.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Tran was conspicuously present at <a href=#>Brown’s 24th birthday celebration</a> in Hollywood on May 3, but didn’t seem happy that the R&B singer’s attention wasn’t solely on her.</p><p>“She didn’t look very happy,” an insider told <strong>Us</strong> at the time. “He didn’t appear to be paying much attention to her and was partying around a lot of girls.”&nbsp;</p><p>The trio have had a complicated history, to say the least. Brown and Tran split in October 2012 after a rollercoaster, yearlong relationship — and Brown reconnected with Rihanna shortly afterward. Tran has previously spoken out about having to deal with the fallout and ongoing hate from Rihanna’s loyal fans.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It was very hard,” she told <a href=#>Rolling Out</a> magazine of the situation. “I try my best just ignore the negativity, which is hard for me because it’s a lot to deal with. But I try to keep a positive mind and stay strong and not put energy into it.”</p><p>Brown, meanwhile, has admitted to being in love with “two people,” <a href=#>in a video</a> he posted shortly after the split. “When you share history with somebody, then you tend to fall in love with somebody else, it’s kinda difficult,” he explained in the video.</p><p>“Is there such a thing as loving two people?” he continued. “I don’t’ know if that’s possible, but for me, I feel like that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoKKewG6u0aiup2Wblr%2BzwcScn55lpKeur3nPmqmtsV2pvKix06Gcq2WRm8GmvoybnK1lkayus7DSZqeim6Sqv6a%2FjGtnamthbHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
