In it, she not only discusses Boosie Badazz’s homophobia towards Lil Nas X but Dave Chappelle’s special as well.</p><p>“Dave Chappelle and Lil boosie are both entirely too grown and entirely too black to be this concerned about other people’s sex lives. It’s highkey embarrassing. Dave Chappelle is also about four years too late to the transphobia outrage attention grab.” she wrote.</p><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=238 data-injectable=false>Banks didn’t just stop there either. Later on in the story, she went so far as to say Chappelle himself is attracted to transwomen, implying that some of these harsh jokes he’s made may be to cover up for his own insecurities.</p><p>“As far as Dave Chappelle goes… you are more than obviously attracted to transwomen. And that is okay! Life is short, Explore!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/azealia-banks-dave-chappelle-response-ig-story-oct-2021-scaled.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/azealia-banks-dave-chappelle-ig-story-oct-2021-3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/azealia-banks-dave-chappelle-ig-story-oct-2021-2.jpg><p data-characters=164 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>In a recent <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram post of his own</a>, Chappelle had discussed the potential of meeting with Netflix employees about the issues people took with his latest special.</p><p>“It’s been said in the press that I was invited to speak to the transgender employees of Netflix and I refused. That is not true — if they had invited me I would have accepted it, although I am confused about what we would be speaking about…I said what I said, and boy, I heard what you said. My God, how could I not? You said you want a safe working environment at Netflix. It seems like I’m the only one that can’t go to the office anymore.”</p><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>While it looks like there’s no way The Closer is leaving Netflix, despite the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">massive petition</a> asking for the company to do so, there’s no doubt that <strong>Dave Chappelle</strong> can’t be feeling good about the absolutely brutal burn he was just given by Azealia Banks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yixsSao6KZXZeur7fSZpuuppuoerC6jJ2Yr51dmLWivM%2Beo6WdXaTDpr6MoaCsZZyWwaa%2F02aqqZ2Tnq6tew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
