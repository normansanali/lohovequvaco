When they arrived near the Pokémon living peacefully, Florges ordered all of her army to attack the Pokémon. A Goomy along with its close friend Wooper ran around panicking, and when the two were seen together, Florges confronted the two as they stared at her in utter fear. Florges then fired a <a href=# title="Moonblast (move)">Moonblast</a> at the Goomy, which sent it flying and caused it to land on a fleeing Swanna.</p><p>Later, Florges made her first on-screen appearance in <i><a href=# title=XY069>Defending the Homeland!</a></i>. She and her army lived in one corner of the wetlands, while the inhabitants were chased over to a secluded area. In this episode, the same Goomy she attacked returned to the homeland, now a Goodra under the ownership of <a href=# title="Ash Ketchum">Ash</a>. When Goodra called for its friends after remembering the good times it had with Wooper, some of the Pokémon under the ownership of Florges recognized it. They alerted Florges about this, who was sitting in a cave where a spring was. Florges then attacked once again along with her army, and Goodra and its friends confronted it. While Goodra and Florges were leading their respective armies of Pokémon and having a showdown, Florges recognized the Goodra as the same Goomy she attacked before and smirked. Soon, it became a showdown between Goodra and Florges. While the two battled well, Goodra learned <a href=# title="Ice Beam (move)">Ice Beam</a> and defeated Florges. However, Goodra was struck by a <a href=# title="Psybeam (move)">Psybeam</a> and <a href=# title="Shadow Ball (move)">Shadow Ball</a> and fainted, and Florges and her army were able to escape. Back at the cave, it is revealed that Florges is bathing her weakened friend, a <a href=# title="Floette (Pokémon)">Floette</a>, in the spring, and after Team Rocket sees this, they call a temporary truce with Florges. As Florges is given commands by Team Rocket, she order one of her Ariados to kidnap <a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu">Pikachu</a>, Dedenne, and Wooper.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=XY070>Beyond the Rainbow!</a></i>, a direct continuation of the previous episode, Goodra, Ash, and Bonnie confront Florges in her cave to rescue their friends. While they confront Florges, she reveals she is taking care of a weakened Floette. Team Rocket later appears and betrays her and decides to take away all of the water in the wetlands. Seeing as Florges's intentions were not truly malicious, Goodra, Ash, and <a href=# title="Bonnie (anime)">Bonnie</a> ally with Florges and together, they save the Pokémon from Team Rocket's grasp, doing so with the help of the inhabitants as well as Florges's own army, who ally with each other as well.</p><p>After Team Rocket is dealt with, Florges helps Goodra restore the wetlands by using Grassy Terrain to restore it while Goodra uses Rain Dance. Florges later sees Floette fully recover in the water, much to Florges's own joy. Floette, happy to have recovered, is grateful to Goodra for saving it. After Ash decides Goodra should stay in the wetlands, Florges and her army make amends with the inhabitants of the wetlands, and they become good friends. Florges, along with her Yanmega, Ariados, Pinsir, Beedrill, and Seviper remain in the wetlands and live peacefully with the rest of the Pokémon.</p><p>Florges made a brief appearance in <i><a href=# title=XY112>Master Class is in Session!</a></i> and <i><a href=# title=XY113>Performing a Pathway to the Future!</a></i>, watching <a href=# title="Serena (anime)">Serena</a>'s Master Class <a href=# title="Pokémon Showcase">Pokémon Showcase</a> from <a href=# title="Gloire City">Gloire City</a> along with <a href=# title=Keanan>Keanan</a> and the other wetland Pokémon.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=XY123>A Diamond in the Rough!</a></i>, Florges appeared with Goodra and Floette before Ash and his friends arrived at the wetlands. She was seen numerous times throughout the episode in an attempt to find the mischievous Carbink by using several berries to lure it out of hiding. During these attempts, she noticed the berries were disappearing and automatically accusing Quagsire of stealing them and sabotaging her attempts to find the Carbink, attacking him on all but one occasion when Floette informed her that it wasn't Quagsire and that it was in fact Carbink. After learning this information, she ordered the Beedrill to find Carbink. She joins the other Pokémon when they are confronting Carbink around the pool of water before Ash and his friends turn up. She is present both when Team Rocket attack using their Carbink Mecha and when everyone is relaxing in the pool of water in the cave after the Carbink have gone home to their cave.</p><p>Florges appered again in <a href=# title=XY131>XY131</a> with Keanan and the other Pokémon living at the wetlands, watching the final round of the <a href=# title="Lumiose Conference">Lumiose Conference</a> on television.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Personality_and_characteristics>Personality and characteristics</span></h2><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/a/a8/Goodra_and_Florges.png/375px-Goodra_and_Florges.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Florges and Goodra<p>When she first appeared in the wetlands, Florges attacked the Pokémon living there with her army of Bug-types and Poison-types. She appears to be a figure of great authority, as she was seen commanding several Yanmega, Ariados, Pinsir, Seviper, and Beedrill. Her aggressive attacks on the wetlands made her appear to be malicious.</p><p>However, it turned out that Florges was only after the spring water, which was said to have a rejuvenating effect on Pokémon, in order to heal her ailing Floette. Seeing this, the wetlands' inhabitants soon made amends with her and she lived peacefully with them along with her army. She appears to be a very caring Pokémon to her Floette, showing much concern over her condition and joy over her recovery. After all ended well, Florges was shown to be friendly, making good friends with the Pokémon in the wetlands.</p><p>The reason Florges attacked the Pokémon in the wetlands is because Team Rocket told her that the Pokémon were the reason Floette wasn't healing, keeping her unaware that they were draining the water Floette needed. After learning Team Rocket lied to her, Florges and her Pokémon army switched allegiances and joined up with Ash and Goodra to defeat Team Rocket.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Moves_used>Moves used</span></h2><table class=roundy><tbody readability=2.4055415617128><tr readability=1.5698924731183><td><table><tbody><tr><td class=roundy><table class=roundy><tbody><tr><td><a href=# class=image><img alt="Blue Flower Florges Moonblast.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/4/41/Blue_Flower_Florges_Moonblast.png/300px-Blue_Flower_Florges_Moonblast.png decoding=async width=200 height=113 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td></tr><tr><td align=center>Using Moonblast</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class=roundy><table class=roundy><tbody><tr><td><a href=# class=image><img alt="Blue Flower Florges Solar Beam.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/4/41/Blue_Flower_Florges_Solar_Beam.png/300px-Blue_Flower_Florges_Solar_Beam.png decoding=async width=200 height=113 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td></tr><tr><td>Using Solar Beam</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td class=roundy></td></tr><tr readability=4><td colspan=2 class=roundy>A <b><span>†</span></b> shows that the move was used recently, unless all moves fit this case or there are fewer than five known moves.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Related_articles>Related articles</span></h2><p>For more information on this Pokémon's species, see <a href=# title="Florges (Pokémon)">Florges</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorzEnaCaZpKquaOtxpqpnZ2eY7umwI6woKShX4rApr6ZgZinnJ2WtqWxzZhoaWlfe7mwvsaeqphgkaO2rrGI</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
