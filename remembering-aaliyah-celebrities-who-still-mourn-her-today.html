Speaking in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with ET</a>, Damon admitted that the singer's death still felt very recent. “I was reflecting [that] there hasn't been one day since she's passed, not one in the 20 years, that I haven't either heard her name, heard her record, or seen a picture of her," Dash said. "Every single day she's present in my life and I feel lucky for that."As a way of honoring her legacy, Damon and Aaliyah's uncle Barry recently collaborated to make her songs available on streaming platforms.</p><h2 id=barry-hankerson><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Barry Hankerson</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aaliyah’s uncle, Barry Hankerson who is the founder of Black Ground Records managed her career up until 1995 when her father, Michael Haughton took over.

In December 2016, a track from the rapper featuring unreleased vocals from Aaliyah was leaked and with that, it became evident that Drake carries the late singer around in his heart.
