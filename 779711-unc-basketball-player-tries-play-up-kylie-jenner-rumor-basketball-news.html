So, if you're just a college kid looking to build your own brand, it couldn't be a bad thing when your name is linked to such a mega star.

A spokesman with the basketball program told TMZ that Wojcik has never attempted to contact Jenner. The spokesman went even further by saying Wojcik is sorry if those rumors have caused in drama to Jenner and her team. The Tar Heels advanced to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament after a dominating victory over Michigan State.</p><span></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Wojcik can continue with the joke relationship to push his name further outside of the sports realm, but the coaching staff at UNC have bigger things to think about. The Tar Heels will meet the Alabama Crimson Tide later this week, with a spot in the Elite 8 on the line. As for Jenner showing up to see her not actual boyfriend play, the magic 8 ball says that is highly unlikely.
