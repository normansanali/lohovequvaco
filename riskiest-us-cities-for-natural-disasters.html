Unfortunately, it's also very easy to assume that the worst could never happen until the tragedy strikes unexpectedly and lives are upended. Of course, while nowhere is entirely free from dangers, some places are more prone to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>severe weather</a> and other catastrophic acts of nature than others—while others remain unprepared to deal with the fallout. And now, new research has helped establish which U.S. cities are the safest and riskiest for natural disasters.</p><p>The findings come from a study conducted by home service company <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Gutter Gnome</a>. Researchers compared data from the 500 biggest U.S. cities across five categories, including hazards risk, vulnerable populations, vulnerable infrastructure, response and recovery, and mobility. They also considered the 18 types of natural disasters defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-citation=true>National Risk Index</a>, including wildfires, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, and floods.</p><p>The categories were then divided into subcategories and weighted for importance to determine a safety score, with the safest possible outcome being 100. Wondering where your hometown landed within the rankings? Read on for the 20 safest and riskiest cities in the U.S. for natural disasters.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>The 10 Most Naturally Beautiful States in the U.S., New Data Shows</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/09/People-walking-in-city.jpg><p>The likelihood of a natural disaster may not be the most pressing concern on potential homebuyers' minds when considering a move, but there is some peace of mind that comes with moving to a historically safer area. However, researchers from the study point out that none of the top-ranked cities deemed safest excelled in all categories, with each showing different strengths and vulnerabilities, proving no area is perfectly immune to tragedy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/boise-idaho-1.jpg><p><strong>Overall safety score:</strong> 49.70</p><p>The Gem State capital stands out for ranking as 24th best in response in recovery.

The Los Angeles suburb is best suited when it comes to vulnerable populations, coming in at 125th overall. But the city earns its title as riskiest for natural disasters thanks to poor showings in hazards risk at 491st and vulnerable infrastructure at 497th.</p><p><strong>For more natural disaster news delivered right to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmq6GjoLamv9NmrKxlk57BqrHSZp2oql2jrrXB0ZqjZpyZqK60wMSrqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
