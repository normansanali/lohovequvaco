He is an Arabian businessman. In addition, he owns the investment firm Kingdom Holding, which has a long list of notable inversions under its belt, including Rotana Group, Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts, Kingdom Hospital-Consulting Clinics, and formerly, Apple, Apple, Twitter, and McDonald's. This guy made kind remarks about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in an interview with CNBC in 2017. He claimed that they don't create any logic. This is not anything that is controlled, regulated, or under supervision. I really don't think this bitcoin stuff is real. It's just going to implode one day, in my opinion. I believe that Enron is about to occur here.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=j-k-rowling><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>J.K. Rowling</span></h2><p><a href=#>The controversial British author </a>mentioned Bitcoin in a tweet, and everyone immediately went bonkers. She only asked for a definition of Bitcoin and received an enormous and overwhelming answer. Rowling received several unkind tweets during the debate. There was a point when she simply wanted to vanish. She declared that she would not join the Bitcoin community. Later, she admitted that the Ethereum holdings were really a joke, and she said that the experience taught her a hard lesson to never belittle bitcoin on Twitter. However, she picked one tweet stating something that does not indeed exist as her favorite explanation of Bitcoin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=howard-marks><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Howard Marks</span></h2><p>https://www.thethings.com/forbes-highest-paid-kylie-jenner-spend-fortune/</p><p>Oaktree Capital Management founder and co-chairman Howard Marks is valued at over $2 billion and is among the 400 <a href=#>wealthiest persons in America by Forbes</a>. Of course, like many other arguments, this did not stop Marks from writing a critical evaluation of the virtual currency. While Marks did not continue to refer to Bitcoin as "turds" or compare it to waffles, he did state that, like Warren Buffett, he does not think the cryptocurrency should have any kind of value. When you look at something, you don't consider whether it will increase or decrease in value tomorrow, in my opinion. Bitcoin doesn't have any inherent worth!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="50 Cent Did Not And Does Not Own Any Bitcoin">50 Cent Did Not And Does Not Own Any Bitcoin</a></span></p><h2 id=charles-munger><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Charles Munger</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If Warren Buffett's position surprised anyone, Charles is probably not going to either. It makes sense that someone as close to Buffett as his vice-chairman would agree with these views and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">express them with vehement scorn and mockery</a>. Munger Night has the record for the silliest labels, including calling people with dementia turds and referring to Bitcoin as such. Additionally, he compares cryptocurrency traders to evil biblical figures like Judas Iscariot and believes that they are no different from being nasty.</p><h2 id=paul-krugman><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Paul Krugman</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even while his voice, particularly his dissident voice, is a touch more well-known than<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> his face in the financial sector,</a> the prominent economist and New Yorker columnist is nonetheless famous. Krugman has repeatedly expressed his disagreement with and skepticism toward cryptocurrencies. But he hasn't stopped there since he has something to say about the <a href=#>most widely used crypto currency</a>. The economist and author Krugman are most known for his piece "Bitcoin is Evil." Here is a portion of Krugman's 2013 attack on the BTC, in which he stated that he was still quite skeptical of the project's ability to succeed. Money needs to serve as a store of value and a means of trade. Furthermore, it is still not evident why Bitcoin should serve as a reliable store of wealth.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="This City Has Banned Mining For Bitcoin">This City Has Banned Mining For Bitcoin</a></span></p><h2 id=jamie-dimon><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jamie Dimon</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another well-known figure who has no love whatsoever for cryptocurrency is Jamie Dimon. Dimon actually seems to be at odds with Bitcoin, personally. One demon Dimon would want to exorcise from the banking system is Bitcoin. Jamie Dimon has been in charge of JP Morgan Chase for a very long time, so it is justifiable that he has a personal grudge against what is perhaps the most significant danger to the banking industry and organized financial organizations. Dimon has made it abundantly clear that he would be as severe with JP employees who also decide to invest foolishly in Bitcoin.</p><h2 id=warren-buffett><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Warren Buffett</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 89-year-old billioniare <a href=#>Warren Buffett who lives in a decent house</a>, usually tops Forbes' annual list of the world's wealthiest individuals and is presently rated seventh in Bloomberg's Billionaire index, has made no secret of his contempt and scorn for cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. Disdain for Warren Buffett may be overused, not because it is inappropriate, but rather because he does not consider Bitcoin to be anything valuable enough to merit the ire of anyone in the first place. According to Warren Buffett, crypto currencies are worthless. Every day, Mr. Buffet comes up with stunning phrases to describe the crypto currency market as rat poison, calling it no currency.</p><h2 id=ben-mckenzie><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Ben McKenzie</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">OC's teen heartthrob Ryan Atwood</a>, a known actor for his role, and a young James Gordon on Gotham have declared Bitcoin his number one adversary. He has grown to be a fierce opponent of cryptocurrency and warns anybody who will listen to stay away from the risky metaverse money. He tweeted that he is just a former teen star advising people to think about the potential for fraud and the downside danger. Easy Money, a forthcoming book he co-wrote with Jacob Silverman of The New Republic, makes the case that bitcoin is a hoax propelled by pointless speculation rather than the actual value. According to some, celebrities that support cryptocurrency are purposefully ruining their audience.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=# title="Crypto Fans React To Elon Musk Not Accepting Bitcoin Payments For Tesla">Crypto Fans React To Elon Musk Not Accepting Bitcoin Payments For Tesla</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmavmKR6pbvNrWSipqaawLV5yKdknKqppcGwew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
