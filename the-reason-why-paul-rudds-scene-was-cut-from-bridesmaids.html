One of these things is making a memorable cameos in a major film project. Actors like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Channing Tatum</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt Damon</a> have done this brilliantly, and it makes the offer to have a small appearance in a project alluring to other performers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in 2011,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bridesmaids</a> hit theaters and took no time at all in becoming a huge success. The film spawned a ton of quotable lines and memorable scenes, and it was directed brilliantly by Paul Feig. It has been reveled that none other than Paul Rudd had a cameo in the movie at one point, but it wound up being cut before the film’s release.</p><p>So, why did Paul Rudd’s cameo get cut out of&nbsp;Bridesmaids? Let’s here what Paul Feig had to say about it.</p><h2 id=paul-rudd-has-had-an-impressive-career>Paul Rudd Has Had An Impressive Career</h2><p>Given that Paul Rudd is an immensely successful and lovable performer, it is hard to believe that he had a cameo that was cut from a comedy movie. Most studios would do just about anything to get the actor on board with a project, and one look at his body of work will reveal why this is the case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After getting his start on&nbsp;Sisters, Rudd became a breakout star in the 90s when he was featured in&nbsp;Clueless, which remains one of the most popular films from the entire decade. He followed this up with&nbsp;Romeo + Juliet, and when the new millennium rolled around, he became a recurring performer on&nbsp;Friends.</p><p>During the 2000s, Rudd’s work with Judd Apatow really took things to another level, as he would appear in hit comedies like&nbsp;Anchorman, The 40-Year-Old Virgin,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Knocked Up. He would have success with other projects like&nbsp;Night at the Museum, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and&nbsp;I Love You, Man.</p><p>In recent years, Rudd has been playing Ant-Man in the MCU, has lent his voice to shows like&nbsp;Bob’s Burgers, and will be starring in&nbsp;Ghostbusters: Afterlife.</p><p>Naturally, the folks making&nbsp;Bridesmaids must have been stoked to get him on board.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About Paul Rudd Turning Down This $2 Billion Film</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-cameo-was-cut-from-bridesmaids>His Cameo Was Cut From Bridesmaids</h2><p>Back in 2011,&nbsp;Bridesmaids became a smash hit at the box office, and it remains one of the best comedies of the 2010s. The film features no shortage of memorable moments, and the cast was brilliant in each scene. Turns out, Paul Rudd was brought on board to make a cameo in the movie.</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MovieFone</a>, “The cut scene had Paul Rudd's character on a blind date with Kristen Wiig's Annie. Their trip to an ice-skating rink starts out well, and Rudd's character seems perfect, but things unravel in hilarious fashion when a child accidentally skates over his finger, leaving Rudd shouting expletives at the child and basically becoming a deranged psycho.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In other words, this role was going to show a completely different side of Rudd, which would have caught fans completely off guard. The premise of the scene sounds hilarious, and filmmaker, Paul Feig, even admitted that filming&nbsp;the scene was hilarious. Unfortunately, the scene would never make it into the final cut of the film, which was not an easy decision for Feig to make.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Close Are Paul Rudd And Jeffrey Dean Morgan? Facts About Their Surprising Friendship</a></span></p><h2 id=why-it-was-cut>Why It Was Cut</h2><p>“It just didn't ring true that in addition to Jon and Chris, she'd be also going out on other dates to try and find more love. It made more sense that she'd be caught between these two guys. Very sadly, we cut all the blind date sequences out of the movie,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said Feig</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Feig also noted the length of the movie was a contributing factor to the scene being excluded from the final cut. As funny as it was, it simply was not a perfect fit and would have caused the movie to be unnecessarily long. It was a tough cut for Feig, but it needed to be done. Fortunately, Feig wasn’t the one to deliver the bad news.</p><p>“Judd delivered the sad news. I felt so bad about it,” he said.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans React To Paul Rudd Giving Seth Rogen A Prank Massage</a></span></p><p>Considering that the final product of the film turned out to be a classic, we can’t disagree with the decision to omit Rudd’s scene from the movie. It would have been great to have had a memorable cameo like that in the film, but at the end of the day, it is important to do what is best for the movie. Clearly, Feig had his finger on the pulse, because he delivered an incredible movie for the fans the enjoy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Close Are Paul Rudd And Seth Rogen?
