Here are seven tips new parents need-to-know…</p><h2>1. Go easy on yourself</h2><p id=eaZOU5ZcQU6a data-wc=71>"Mainly I would say to remember that EVERYTHING is a phase…so many nights googling only to find it's not a problem anymore a week later. I’d also say be gentle on yourself," says <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Charlotte Stirling-Reed</a>, The Baby & Child Nutritionist and Expert Speaker at <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Baby Show</a>. "Parenting is TOUGH, challenging and it makes us question everything.<strong>&nbsp;If you’re worried about how good a parent you are, you’re probably already brilliant!"</strong></p><p id=ehEk1l_Gija5 data-wc=11><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Most popular baby names and trends to expect in 2023</a></strong></p><h2>2. Trust your instincts</h2><p id=eP6fpmqkmAPT data-wc=70><a class=hm-link href=#>Andrea Caamano</a>, <strong>HELLO!</strong>'s website editor, says: "Trust your instinct in regards to everything but specifically your child's health. If you are concerned over something despite the doctors brushing it off, insist on getting the help your child needs. I was sure my son had several allergies by the age of five months and despite being told it was too soon to know, we fought for tests that confirmed our suspicions."</p><h2>3. Follow safe sleep guidelines</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bf4ee1881da0-baby-sleeping-moses-basket-z.jpg><p id=eJQkhid6qO9A style=text-align:center data-wc=12><strong>A Moses basket is ideal for safe sleep in the early months</strong></p><p id=eTJhliSpmx2j data-wc=62>"For the first six months, safer sleep guidelines advise that your baby sleeps in the same room as you for both daytime naps and night-time too. This is when having a Moses basket is ideal because you will be able to move it from room to room between naps," Lynda Harding, Founder of iconic sleep brand, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Sweet Dreamers</a> and Nursery Owner, says.</p><p id=eWhjlmB8lF6_ data-wc=67>&nbsp;"In reality, babies often fall asleep in the car seat, buggy or anywhere they are comfy. If this happens, move your baby to the Moses basket, bedside crib or cot in the same room as you so as to ensure that your baby is sleeping safely. That way you also keep an eye on them while they are sleeping and also get a bit of rest too."</p><p id=ey_YhfEJr9AA data-wc=10><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>How to dress babies for sleep in cold weather</a></strong></p><p id=eEHnXJ0hOL_S data-wc=6><strong>SHOP: <a class=hm-link href=#>Best Moses baskets for newborns</a></strong></p><p id=e1a7YtpDNUwy data-wc=45>Lynda adds: "Make sure you <a class=hm-link href=#>follow safer sleep guidelines</a> by always placing your baby to sleep on their back with their feet to the foot of their sleep space, and also keep the sleep space clear of any duvets, pillows, cot bumpers or soft toys."</p><h2>4. Embrace the changes that motherhood brings</h2><p id=eKfXFGWUB5MM data-wc=46>"Becoming a mother changes you completely. It's ok to admit that you miss the old you, but as the months pass, and as each phase comes and goes, you will find that you embrace this newer version of you," says <a class=hm-link href=#>Danielle Stacey</a>, <strong>HELLO!</strong>'s Online Royal Correspondent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c13fe97be47d-woman-holding-baby-z.jpg><p id=eslptK6F_Ojf style=text-align:center data-wc=6><strong>Becoming a parent changes you completely</strong></p><h2>5. Help your newborn to sleep soundly with white and pink noise</h2><p id=e1As2qPoYbLO data-wc=26>Lynda Harding says white and pink noise can be key in helping newborns to sleep more soundly, and is a tool every new parent should know.</p><p id=eyk9r10dru7z data-wc=50>"Have you ever wondered why white noise and pink noise are so effective as helping settle young babies to sleep? It's because these low bass frequency sounds remind the baby of their time in the womb, and the comforting experience that they had when they were in there," she says.</p><p id=eKCg8wfDzaWR data-wc=15><strong>SHOP: <a class=hm-link href=#>The best-rated baby monitors to give both parents and babies a peaceful night's sleep</a></strong></p><p id=e6C7AqRz7GmX data-wc=81>"The iconic <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>ewan the Dream Sheep</a> plays both white and pink noise sounds all combined with a mum’s resting heartbeat, plus he also has a soft red glow which helps your baby release the sleepy hormone melatonin. This magic combination means that ewan really does help the transition from womb to world. Use ewan’s handy Velcro tail to suspend him from the cot bars/Moses basket or crib, meaning you can follow safer sleep guidelines by keeping your baby's sleep space clear."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2bdf18837f12-ewan-dream-sheep-glow-z.jpg><p id=e6kfq9SmayTQ style=text-align:center data-wc=10><strong>White and pink noise can help babies to sleep soundly</strong></p><h2>6. Sleep when you can, and try to enjoy every stage</h2><p id=eYjfXBAV4cNi data-wc=70><strong>"My advice for new parents would be to sleep when you can, try not to overthink everything and overall, just try and enjoy every stage. It really does go too fast.</strong> Everyone tells you you'll miss whatever stage you're at, and you don't believe them but it's funny how you look back on the sleepless nights with fondness when they're finally sleeping through," says <a class=hm-link href=#>Katherine Robinson</a>, <strong>HELLO!</strong>'s Senior Lifestyle Editor.</p><p id=eBNz0_m9-_KR data-wc=71>"Also, take photos of the mundane stuff, baths, playtime, tummy time, messy food play. And get your other half to take photos of you, even if you look like rubbish. All my babies' photos feature my other half, or just the baby. Listen to advice with a nod and a smile and just ignore the bits that don't fit your parenting style. If they're fed, clean and healthy then you're winning!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f67f084cd49c-new-parents-with-baby-z.jpg><p id=en-O6U62Bde- style=text-align:center data-wc=9><strong>New parents are often bombarded with well-meaning parenting advice</strong></p><h2>7. Get through sleep regressions with ease</h2><p id=ef6Pn7jBeQwk data-wc=51>Did you know babies move from two sleep cycles to four sleep cycles at around 3 to 4 months and this coincides with the dreaded '4-month sleep regression'. This is when there is lots of activity and rapid brain development going on which can seriously disrupt your little one's sleep patterns.</p><p id=eloIgl1KAbga data-wc=9><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>When do babies start sleeping through the night?</a></strong></p><p id=eza-iTakst28 data-wc=15><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Lynda Harding</a> has shared her top tips to help with your baby's 4-month sleep regression:</p><h2>How to handle the four month sleep regression</h2><ul><li>Make sure your baby gets exposed to lots of natural day light and keep them active while they are awake.</li><li>Look for signs of sleepiness, this will be the queue for you to start the bedtime routine.</li><li>Try to create a good sleep environment; obviously make sure it's dark, calm with as little stimulation as possible and why not try some white noise?</li><li>Make sure you stick to a consistent bedtime routine which could include bath, a feed - make sure they are well fed, and your baby is winded, and then bed.</li><li>When your baby wakes for a feed in the middle of the night, try to do so as quietly as possible to avoid over stimulation.</li></ul><h2>8. Don't get hung up on routines</h2><p id=e4aMcqIrH_v8 data-wc=86>"The most popular reasons for not wanting to get out and about with a baby can be the lack of routine, or fear of them missing out on crucial naps during the daytime. If you have worked hard on putting a routine into place, it is only normal to feel concerned about how that might go on a day out," says parenting coach <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Heidi Skudder</a>, who has launched <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Aptamil's 'Picnic Locator'</a>, a bespoke online tool that helps parents identify the most convenient parks locally to them.</p><p id=e17AaIR9E1q8 data-wc=78>"The reality is, 'off routine' days as I like to call them, are good for the soul. Do not worry about your baby's naps being longer/shorter, or at a different time to if they were at home sticking to their routine. Try and relax into your day and let them fall asleep when they need to, without too much stress. If they haven’t slept much that day, then you can just pop them in bed a little earlier.</p><p id=euAtUJcg8oBj data-wc=27>"Having fun outside of the home and spending precious time together is more important than staying at home every single day and strictly sticking to your routine."</p><h2>9. Keep organised with lists</h2><p id=eZbO-_J4EuRf data-wc=57>"We all know how long it can take to get out of the door with babies in tow. Gone are the days of leaving the house with a small bag, or just your keys, wallet and phone! Little people need a huge amount of stuff with them, especially if going out for a full day," Heidi says.</p><p id=e0kWyGGl4JCI data-wc=76>"Preparation is key in ensuring that nothing is forgotten, so making a list of everything that you need the day before is essential. Sit down with a cup of tea for five minutes and run through the day in your mind, noting down anything on your phone notes that you might need for your baby. It can help to re-visit the list a little later on too, just to ensure you have everything you will need."</p><p id=enIiO_0xcjQ3 data-wc=22></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
