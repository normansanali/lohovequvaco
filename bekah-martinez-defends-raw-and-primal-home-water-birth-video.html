Don’t get me wrong; my experience with Franklin’s birth was beyond what I could have hoped for. It was ecstatic— I was literally laughing and joking between contractions and smiling through pushing. It was a dream come true. Strangely though, the footage felt so raw and primal that I was actually uncomfortable watching it back. I sat with this feeling for a while, and I came to a couple conclusions. One, that I truly was scared of the mean things people might say about something so sacred to me. But also, more importantly, I realized that I felt uncomfortable watching myself in that much POWER. I realized I still had so many negative, subconscious, deeply-embedded thoughts telling me that I wasn’t feminine enough; that I looked and sounded weird. I projected so many insecurities onto an experience that was truly one of the most powerful, magical moments of my life. This is a moment worth sharing; so in advance— f*ck the haters. ♥️ Video by @laurenguilfordbirths — thank you for so beautifully capturing the births of both my children! And a very, VERY special thanks to the following people: @lindseymeehleis you did so much by doing so little. You believed in my ability to birth my baby without intervention. You respected my autonomy when I refused to be checked. You watched with joy on the sidelines as I caught my own baby. You massaged my legs with oils while the placenta came. You never once rushed me as I lingered in Franklin’s arrival. Thank you for everything ✨ Thank you to @pipyopi for just being you, and being with me, and giving me the two best gifts of my life. ♥️ And last but DEFINITELY not least, thank you to my mom. This woman was my spirit guide through both births of my children. I can’t count the number of comments I’ve received asking who my amazing doula was. I am incredibly lucky to have a mother who is so intuitive, strong, encouraging, nurturing, and present. It is something I don’t take for granted. I love you, mom.</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=#>bekah</a> (@bekah) on Aug 4, 2020 at 3:34pm PDT</p><p class=x_p3><span class=x_s1>The&nbsp;“Chatty Broads”&nbsp;podcast cohost felt&nbsp;“uncomfortable” watching the&nbsp;“raw and primal” footage,&nbsp;however. “I sat with this feeling for a while, and I came to a couple conclusions,”&nbsp;she explained. “I realized I still had so many negative, subconscious, deeply-embedded thoughts telling me that I wasn’t feminine enough; that I looked and sounded weird.
