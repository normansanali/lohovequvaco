While Kanye has never spoken about black being his favorite, we can make a safe assumption here. Other elements he uses in his outfits include oversized coats and skinny jeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Besides black, Kanye likes to wear neutral and muted colors like gray, army green, coffee khaki, and washed blue. He uses denim often, and he likes to layer it too. Layering is an important part of his wardrobe, and he isn’t afraid to wear denim on denim either. His outfits are generally aimed at creating a low-key sense of leisure, except for events where he means to make a statement.</p><p>Kanye has an amazing fashion sense, so it is no surprise that he has ventured into the world of high fashion. His fashion line is called Yeezy, and it <a href=# rel=noopener>debuted</a> at the New York Fashion Week of Fall 2015. Kanye sees this line as “<a href=# rel=noopener>the Hermès of sportswear</a>.” The collection tends to be monochromatic in grays, browns, blacks, and even some oranges – and the fits tend to be extremes; either skin-tight or loose enough for the body to be swallowed completely.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>But <a href=# rel=noopener>the most famous part</a> of the Yeezy empire is the sneakers. Take for instance the iconic Yeezy Boost 350, which was made in collaboration with Adidas Originals. The sneakers were an instant hit, and they came in gray. The price soon hit four figures after hundreds of fans swarmed to Adidas stores to get their hands on a pair. The shoes have since turned into a pop-cultural sensation, and have been seen on the feet of celebrities like Pharrell Williams and Gigi Hadid.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kanye Simply Cannot Stand Blue&nbsp;</h2><p>While most celebrities tend to be a bit conservative in interviews and try not to reveal too much about themselves, keeping their opinions to the absolute bare minimum, Kanye is almost always enthusiastic in the strangest ways and goes into detail about the strangest things. In an interview he spoke about how he hates the color blue with a passion, <a href=# rel=noopener>saying</a>, “I don’t use blue. I don’t like it. It bugs me out. I hate it.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Even though Yeezy is Kanye most famous fashion venture, his biggest fashion achievement might just be his <a href=# rel=noopener>infamous transformation</a> of Kim Kardashian West’s style after he began dating her, and which became apparent in 2012.</p><p>Kanye was able to swap Kim’s early 2000s aesthetic – bright makeup and voluminous hair complimenting low-rise skinny jeans and leggings, mid-calf length boots, and body con dresses from – for a more modern aesthetic – a subtler and more contoured makeup style, sleek hair, and monochromatic and minimalist outfits. He introduced Kim to more timeless brands like Givenchy, Versace, Balmain, and Azzedine Alaïa.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCfmqxdnsBut8CnsJ5lp5rAtb%2BMn5ivp6KewaZ5wqijqKpf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
