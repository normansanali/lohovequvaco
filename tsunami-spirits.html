Meanwhile, water traveled six miles inland in Sendai.</p><p>A total of 217 square miles were flooded, which included the destruction of hospitals, schools, businesses, homes, railways, and everything else.

According to Parry, seeing a tsunami ghost in the months following the earthquake was not rare.</p><p>“People’s grief and loss and anguish came out,” he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told NPR in 2014</a>. “And what also came out after a few months were stories of ghosts and hauntings and supernatural events to the extent that it almost seemed like an epidemic.”</p><p>In 2016, a graduate student of sociology named Yuka Kudo traveled to one of the cities most ravaged by the disaster, Ishinomaki, in order to study this epidemic. She focused specifically on the town’s cab drivers, who claimed to have picked up passengers that turned out to be tsunami ghosts.</p>France 24 interviews Japanese cab drivers about their experiences with tsunami spirits.<p>Ishinomaki suffered 3,097 deaths and reported 2,770 missing persons. A whopping 50,000 buildings had been destroyed there as well. The decimated city saw most of its population relocate, with aimless cab drivers hoping for the best on their shifts. Out of the 100 cabbies Kudo prodded for supernatural stories, seven volunteered.</p><p>The first cabbie told Kudo of an encounter he had in the summer of 2011. It had only been a few months since the tsunami, and there were barely any customers. He was naturally shocked to suddenly spot a young woman hailing him down in a particularly hard-hit area.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-300746 alt="Train Wreckage Following Japan Tsunami" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/train-wreckage-following-japan-tsunami.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-300746 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>A train that was was carried 200 meters from the tracks in Ishinomaki.</span></p><p>Wearing a heavy winter coat in the middle of summer, the figure was also completely drenched. The driver barely had time to realize that it hadn’t rained in days before she climbed into the back seat and asked to be driven to the largely-abandoned Minamihama district.</p><p>“That area is almost empty,” he said while switching on the meter. “Are you sure?” There was a long silence. Then, in a shivering voice, the woman asked: “Have I died?”</p><p>The terrified driver turned around to face the customer, but found absolutely nothing nor anyone in his car.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-300595 alt="Yurei Illustration" width=900 height=699 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/yurei-illustration.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-300595 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>An illustration of yūrei, which translates to “ghost,” from Japan’s Shinto-inspired folklore.</span></p><p>Another cabbie told Kudo that he picked up a confused-looking man in his 20s who kept pointing forward when asked where he needed to go. Finally, he said simply, “Hiyoriyama,” a mountain park near the city. After careening up the mountain near Ishinomaki, the driver dropped his customer on a plateau at the summit. But when he turned around to be paid, there was nobody in his car.</p><p>Parry’s investigative book also documents how one man in Kurihara said that he now despises the rain, as he constantly sees the eyes of tsunami victims he knew in the puddles.</p><p>The ghost of an old woman is said to haunt a refugee home in Onagawa and to have regularly sat down for a cup of tea there.

Parry also spoke with Buddhist priest Reverend Taio Kaneda, who told him about a man named Takashi Ono who had become possessed. Kaneda and Ono both lived miles from the coastline, where the worst of the disaster had occurred. While Kaneda helped countless people properly bury their loved ones, Ono stayed away from the disaster zone until he finally went on his own to face it months later.</p><p>After seeing the monumental loss and devastation along the beaches, he returned home and had dinner with his family. Afterwards, he went into the backyard and started rolling in the mud, speaking in a guttural, aggressive way. His family was mortified. The next day, he had no recollection of what he had done.</p>Locals share their encounters with tsunami spirits following the disaster.<p>While there are no clear-cut answers to these incidents, perhaps a closer look at the history of Japan’s relationship with the spirit realm can provide some insight into these tsunami ghosts.</p><h2>Could Tsunami Spirits Be A Manifestation Of Grief?</h2><p>Japan has had a longstanding cultural relationship with ghosts, or yūrei. In the Shinto religion, which means literally “the way of the gods” and is the indigenous faith of the Japanese people, spirits inhabit all things animate and inanimate. Many Japanese came to believe that because the tsunami took people before they were ready to die, their restless spirit still wanders the plane of reality.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-300597 alt="Aerial View Of Sendai" width=900 height=601 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aerial-view-of-sendai.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-300597 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>An aerial view of Sendai, which saw waters reach six miles inland.</span></p><p>And despite global polls suggesting that Japan is one of the least religious nations on the planet, Parry has come to learn otherwise.</p><p>“I hadn’t realized how real and alive the cult of the ancestors and the cult of the dead is,” Parry reported. “The other thing I learned is something I should have known anyway, but that grief and trauma express themselves often very indirectly.”</p><p>Parry believes that Ono is one such example of this. Even though Kaneda performed an exorcism on him, as well as many others who believed they were possessed by tsunami spirits, Parry is unconvinced that the supernatural is really behind this phenomenon. But he did agree with Kaneda on the principle that these spirits are real to whomever believes to have seen them, and in that context, should be taken seriously.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-300583 alt="Phone Of The Wind" width=900 height=506 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/phone-of-the-wind.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-300583 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>YouTube</span><span class=caption-body>The “phone of the wind” in Otsuchi, which allows those in mourning to express their grief into the ether.</span></p><p>“He never said to me that he didn’t believe them… He said what matters is that people believe in them,” said Parry. “It doesn’t really matter whether you believe in ghosts. What’s real is the suffering and the pain.”</p><p>Parry theorizes that the widespread phenomenon of tsunami ghosts is likely the manifestation of a nation processing its collective trauma and grief. Coastal towns across Japan have indeed found other, creative ways to grieve. For instance, the town of Otsuchi installed a phone booth called “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">phone of the wild</a>” atop a hill overlooking the ocean that allows those in mourning to send messages to their loved ones in another realm.</p>Official trailer for Netflix’s Unsolved Mysteries: Volume 2.<p>Dr. Charles R. Figley of the School of Social Work at Tulane University confirmed that trauma shared by the masses often produces strange, collective reactions. “It is not uncommon for fellow survivors of catastrophic loss and dislocation to have common reactions, be they paranormal sightings, sounds, or smells,” he said.</p><p>“Ghosts, for some, are more tolerable than the void created by death.”</p><p>After learning about Japan’s tsunami spirits, read about <a href=#>the eerie swarm of North Korean ghost ships found in Japan</a> or <a href=#>Aokigahara, Japan’s notorious Suicide Forest</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1v9SnmKahXai9qr7Irao%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
