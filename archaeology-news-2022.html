This makes it several decades older than another historic coin that was unearthed in Canada in 2021, which was minted in the 1490s.</p><p>And this new find may end up rewriting the history books.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-414947 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/archaeology-news-2022.jpg alt="Archaeology News 2022" width=900 height=483 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-414947 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Government of Newfoundland and Labrador</span><span class=caption-body>The Henry VI quarter noble that was recently discovered on Newfoundland’s south coast.</span></p><p>After all, historians have debated for years over who “discovered” — or rediscovered — the Americas. Most are aware of Christopher Columbus’ journey in 1492, but Norse explorer <a href=# rel=noopener>Leif Erikson</a> has received more attention in recent years since he set foot on modern-day Newfoundland and other parts of North America nearly four centuries before Columbus’ voyage.</p><p>For years, it was believed that the next European to see Newfoundland was the Italian explorer John Cabot, who arrived there in 1497 (just a few years after Columbus’ trip). But since the newly found coin in Newfoundland was minted decades before Cabot’s arrival, the recent discovery might completely upend the existing narrative, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to Ancient Origins</a>.</p><p>And since the coin was minted in England, that brings another fascinating twist — as historians believed that English people were completely unaware of Newfoundland and the rest of North America when the coin was created. So it’s no wonder why experts are calling the new discovery “so exciting.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyivsKhmJ6nnKS0unnNnq6sZWJlf3M%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
