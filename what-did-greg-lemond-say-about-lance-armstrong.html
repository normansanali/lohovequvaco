Gregory James LeMond, a retired professional cyclist from America, achieved remarkable success in road racing. He clinched the Tour de France thrice and also won the Road Race World Championship twice, making him the sole American male to have accomplished this feat.</p><p>A lot of people have been inquiring lot about what Greg LeMond said about Lance and making various research about it on the internet.</p><p>This article talks about Greg LeMond and everything there is to know about what he said about Lance Armstrong.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Biography of Greg LeMond</h2><p>Gregory James LeMond, born on June 26, 1961, is an American former professional road racing cyclist. Born in Lakewood, California, LeMond was introduced to cycling at a young age by his father, who worked as a bicycle wholesaler. He quickly showed remarkable talent and began competing in local races as a teenager.</p><p>LeMond’s professional career kicked off in 1981 when he signed with the Renault-Elf-Gitane team. In 1983, he achieved his first major victory by winning the World Road Race Championship in Switzerland, becoming the youngest cyclist ever to win the title. He went on to win this championship again in 1989.</p><p>LeMond’s greatest achievement came in the Tour de France, where he emerged victorious three times. His first win came in 1986, followed by back-to-back victories in 1989 and 1990.</p><p>His 1989 triumph is often regarded as one of the most dramatic moments in the race’s history, where he edged out Frenchman Laurent Fignon by just eight seconds in the final stage to claim the yellow jersey.</p><p>LeMond’s success in the Tour de France was even more remarkable considering the numerous setbacks he faced throughout his career. In 1987, he suffered serious injuries after being accidentally shot while hunting, and it was initially unclear whether he would ever ride again. However, he made a remarkable recovery and returned to win the Tour de France in 1989.</p><p>LeMond retired from competitive cycling in 1994, but his legacy lives on as one of America’s greatest cyclists. In addition to his three Tour de France wins and two World Championship titles, he also won several other notable races, including the prestigious Paris-Nice and Dauphiné Libéré.</p><p>Off the bike, LeMond has remained active in promoting cycling and advocating for safer roads for cyclists. He has also been involved in developing new cycling technologies, including the first carbon fiber bike frames. LeMond’s impact on the sport of cycling cannot be overstated, and he will always be remembered as one of its greatest ambassadors.</p><p>During a 2007 interview, LeMond made allegations against Armstrong, claiming that he attempted to ruin his connection with Trek bicycles. In LeMond’s own words, Armstrong was described as “I just think he’s not a good person and that’s all I can say. I mean, he’s a facade, if you knew the real Lance Armstrong that I know.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfmqxdmbalecarnKBlnJq6sLrDZqqasV2Wr7DB02ajmqaTmnqivsysq6unnpx8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
