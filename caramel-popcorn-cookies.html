These Caramel Popcorn cookies are like nothing I have ever tasted before in my life.
The first time I made them, I was shocked because they were crunchy and sweet and chewy and had the best buttery caramel flavor."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I like the additional salt because it cuts the sweetness of the caramel corn and is the perfect compliment</li><li><strong>Brown Sugar</strong> — when you add brown sugar to cookies, it makes a chewier cookie. The higher ratio of brown sugar to sugar creates the perfect, chewy texture</li><li><strong>Sugar</strong> — this helps to give those coveted crisp edges to cookies</li><li><strong>Eggs</strong> — this recipe calls for one whole egg and one egg yolk. The extra egg yolk gives the cookies extra richness without drying them out</li><li><strong>Vanilla Extract</strong> — my vanilla extract of choice is either Nielsen-Massey or real, authentic Mexican vanilla, found online</li><li><strong>Flour</strong> — this recipe calls for all-purpose flour</li><li><strong>Baking Soda</strong> — this is a leavening agent that is activated by brown sugar and will allow the cookies to raise in the oven</li><li><strong>Baking Powder</strong> — another leavening agent that will give the cookies loft</li><li><strong>Salt</strong> — an integral ingredient that brings out the flavor and balances out the sweetness</li><li><strong>Caramel Corn</strong> — use homemade caramel corn or store-bought caramel corn. I have used both homemade and store-bought with great success. This recipe calls for 4-6 cups of caramel corn. A typical bag of caramel corn is 6 cups for 8 ounces.</li></ul><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Caramel-Popcorn-Cookies-1-720x932.jpg alt="Caramel Popcorn Cookies are made with brown sugar cookie dough with chewy, crunchy, caramel popcorn pieces all throughout the cookie.

Stop and scrape the sides of the bowl, halfway through the time to ensure even mixing. This helps to give the butter time to coat the sugar crystals to create a smooth and creamy cookie texture.</li><li>Add egg, egg yolk, and vanilla and mix for 1 minute longer.</li><li>Fold in flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Add in 4 cups of caramel corn and mix for about 30 seconds to 1 minute to help break up some of the caramel corn into smaller pieces.</li><li>Cover and chill in the refrigerator for 15-30 minutes.</li><li>Line <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B0049C2S32 data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow>light-colored baking sheets</a>with <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B0161UTDM8 data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow>parchment paper</a>.
