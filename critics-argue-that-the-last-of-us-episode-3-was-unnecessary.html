Recommended Videos HBO’s latest episode of The Last of Us sparked a debate amongst fans after it aired yesterday. The episode, “Long Long Time” took the “biggest departures” from the source material as it changed the backstories of Bill and Frank. It went from a hateful and sad relationship to something that lasted for more than a decade. And it was this change that caused a split among viewers."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Instead, it was an hour-long romance episode about Bill and Frank’s blossoming relationship and how they died on their own terms in the middle of the apocalypse. While <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the episode received praise from viewers</a>, some thought the episode was a filler. As of writing, the episode currently sits at&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">8.3 stars on IMDB</a>.

More specifically, Ellie and Bill’s interaction. In the games, Ellie and Bill argue with each other due to Bill’s suspicions of people he doesn’t trust. Some fans believed that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it was somewhat of a missed opportunity</a>&nbsp;to see a comedic interaction between the two, especially since Nick Offerman, the actor who played Bill, is a comedian. But at the same time, they were fine with the change.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>it’s a actually a crime that they took the bill/ellie scenes away from us THEY WERE SO CHAOTIC <a href=#>#thelastofus</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/QALd4nfCIv</a></p>— joel miller defender TLOU SPOILERS (@ellievjoel) <a href=#>January 30, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=564 data-current-count=864 data-injectable=true>However, there were arguments shared on how the episode played a role in Joel and Ellie’s story, even if it wasn’t focused on them. The first was how in the games, Joel and Ellie were helping Bill find a car battery. While there might be some interesting interactions,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">seeing that transformed into a TV format might not be as entertaining as you may think.</a>&nbsp;So it made sense why the writers wanted to change it. Also, people who played the games believe that the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">original portrayal of Bill and Frank had little plot development&nbsp;</a>compared to the show.</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>Lastly, there was the letter that Bill leaves behind for Joel. It showed how Bill wanted to survive but changed the moment he met Frank. Fans believe&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joel learns something from Bill’s writing,</a>&nbsp;which makes Bill and Frank’s relationship some sort of catalyst for Joel’s future actions with Ellie.</p><p data-characters=556 data-current-count=878 data-injectable=true>In a behind-the-scenes video of episode three, The Last of Us&nbsp;showrunner, Neil Druckmann explains his philosophy when it comes to following or deviating from the original story. He says that if the new version of the story is better, they deviate. And if the writing for the episode is somewhat similar to the game, they have to follow the source material. Both he and Craig Mazin have acknowledged that this episode might receive criticism due to the changes made. Yet, both took the opportunity to expand on these two characters and believe it paid off.</p><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=254 data-injectable=false>At the end of the day, the episode still followed what needed to happen like in the games — Joel got Bill’s car to take Ellie to the Fireflies. Except this time, he might have received some sort of wisdom that Bill obtained from his relationship.</p><p data-characters=62 data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false>New episodes of The Last of Us streams every Sunday on HBO Max</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ykvsitoJyrXZa%2FqMHEZquhmaRiwamxjKWYrKxdpLNuwdJmnKmho6SxpnmSZq6aq12qu6%2Bxwp6qrJmirnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
