</strong>2024-08-26</div><p><span>Seattle, a major Washington city, holds the Record as a breeding ground that has spawned many hip-hop artists who are playing an influential role in redefining modern hip-hop.&nbsp;2018 was truly a big year for many artists in the city, but none of them had it like Lil Mosey, a Seattle-born teenager who became an instant icon in and beyond. the music community after his commercial single.&nbsp;</span><span>Noticed</span><span>&nbsp;exploded online.&nbsp;Prior to his professional breakthrough, the young star was not widely known even in Seattle, his hometown, but today Mosey has become an integral part of the hip-hop community, a person with a flow, a sound and musical skills.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Lil Mosey’s Bio (Age), Ethnicity</span></strong></h2><p><span>Lately, we’ve seen a lot of new talent struggling to rise to the top of the music industry.&nbsp;While many of them prefer to make their way using their own names, others seem very comfortable with the “Lil” prefix, which usually appears in front of the real name(s). of an artist.&nbsp;Although Mosey was born Lathan Moses Echols, he is best known by the stage name Lil Mosey.&nbsp;The young rapper was born on January 25, 2002 on American soil, notably in Seattle (Washington), in the United States.</span></p><p><span>Although Lil Mosey was born and raised in Seattle, he hails from Mountlake Terrace, Washington, USA.&nbsp;He is an American citizen due to his birth in the United States and is of white ethnicity.</span></p><p><span>The young MC attended Mountlake Terrace High School, but later dropped out to start music full time.&nbsp;Information about his family, background, siblings and childhood experience is not available online at the time of writing.</span></p><p><span>Regarding his growing career, Lil Mosey decided to make his way in the industry after his breakthrough.&nbsp;</span><span>Reassemble</span><span>&nbsp;started gaining traction on SoundCloud, with over ten million views on YouTube.&nbsp;Shortly after&nbsp;</span><span>Remount</span><span>&nbsp;dropped, Mosey served the music industry with his second commercial single titled&nbsp;</span><span>Boof Pack,</span><span>&nbsp;which garnered over 10 million views on YouTube after its release on March 14, 2018.</span></p><p><span>Riding on the success of her first two singles, Lathan then released her third single along with a music video.&nbsp;It was the favorable outcome of the hit song – Noticed, which skyrocketed him in the industry, on SoundCloud and other social media platforms.&nbsp;Noted&nbsp;</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;who burst into the music business on July 20, 2018, also peaked at No. 80 on the Billboard Hot 100, announcing that Lil Mosey was an up-and-coming star to watch.</span></p><p><span>Since the young rapper rose to fame, he has worked with notable young artists such as Juice WRLD and YBN Cordae.&nbsp;He recently embarked on his third tour with the duo after a successful tour of the United States with Smooky Margielaa for the first time and then with SmokePurpp.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>There’s no doubt that the Seattle-born hitmaker is ready to take over for many of the elite rappers in the hip-hop community if he doesn’t slow down and keep working hard in the competitive industry.&nbsp;We are convinced that his many efforts will bear fruit one day or another in the near future.&nbsp;As of 2018, his net worth is estimated at $750,000.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Parents</span></strong></h2><p><span>Unlike their rising rapper son, Lil Mosey’s parents are strangers to stardom.&nbsp;They are not popular and for this reason their identities are not known to the public.&nbsp;Additionally, Mosey barely talks about his parents on camera, but we know from an interview with the starlet a while ago that his mother never supported him leaving high school to pursue a career in the music.</span></p><p><span>The young rapper once shared that his mother felt he was still young to start a career in showbiz and she wanted him to stay for a while before getting into music.&nbsp;It seems Mosey’s mother couldn’t change her son’s mind and is now his biggest fan.&nbsp;As for her father, he hasn’t revealed what kind of person he is or the roles he played in her life and career.&nbsp;Essentially, it looks like the rapper has supportive parents as well.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height – How tall is it?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Lil Mosey, who is primarily recognized by his chest tattoo that reads “Thank God,” stands 5ft 6in tall.&nbsp;However, details about the&nbsp;</span><span>Fit Crooner</span><span>&nbsp;‘s body measurements are not up for public scrutiny.&nbsp;His videos and pictures that he shares online clearly show that he has dark brown eyes and hair.</span></p><p
