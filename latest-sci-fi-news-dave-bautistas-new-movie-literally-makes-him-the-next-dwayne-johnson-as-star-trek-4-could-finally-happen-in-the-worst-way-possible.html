Here’s a hint: they’re also not popular with Star Wars lovers. Another hint: their name rhymes with Smay Smay Smabrams. Have a think, you’ll work it out…</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Dave Bautista says he doesn’t want to be the next Rock, but his new sci-fi movie says otherwise</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/army-of-the-dead-dave-bautista-scott-ward.jpg><p data-characters=541 data-current-count=841 data-injectable=true>Dave Bautista has got people talking by taking a swipe at Dwayne Johnson <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in a recent interview</a>, claiming that he has no interest in being the “next Rock” as he wants to be a “good” and “respected” actor instead. It’s ironic, then, that the Glass Onion star is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pretty literally becoming the next Rock</a> in one of his upcoming movies, sci-fi flick Universe’s Most Wanted, which will see him partner up with director Brad Peyton — who has had Johnson star in a total of three of his past movies.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Avatar: The Way of Water makes waves as it officially becomes one of the 10 biggest movies of all time</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/avatar-the-way-of-water.jpg><p data-characters=516 data-current-count=816 data-injectable=true>Say what you like about James Cameron, but the man knows how to make a hit movie. Proving all the haters wrong, Avatar: The Way of Water has sailed straight into <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the 10 biggest movies at the box office</a> of all time, after just three weeks in cinemas. It’s currently ranking higher than The Avengers — with Spider-Man: No Way Home being the next domino to fall. The outer-space sequel is also now officially the highest-grossing film of 2022, once again leaving Marvel far in the dust. Your move, Kevin Feige.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>As Netflix prepares to reboot, fans remember the original mighty movie entry in a colorful franchise nearly 30 years on</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-the-movie-1.jpg><p data-characters=526 data-current-count=826 data-injectable=false>The Power Rangers franchise is celebrating its 30th anniversary in 2023, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a Mighty Morphin reunion coming</a> later this year, so it’s no surprise <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">nostalgic fans are revisiting the original movie</a> based around the teenagers with attitude with rose-tinted glasses right now. Don’t forget, Netflix is currently <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">working on a reboot of the IP</a>, but it seems that those who grew up with the 1995 flick are going to find it hard to be won over by the shiny, new version. Basically, it’s bring back Ivan Ooze or bust.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoo5qslajBbr%2FComSfoV2jsri%2FjJ2Yr51dl662wMisq5qrXaOyuHnMqK2inV2htrWx0ZqjpbFdoq6ssdJmn6KlXam1pnnNnq%2BtZZSsrrq6xGahqKCeqLyvecCsZKyskad6tb7EpGRtZZOkwq2wjJ%2Bgp5mcocZutMCpp56mXZ67bsDHnmSwp6KowW7DwLJkqaejqLajuMRo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
