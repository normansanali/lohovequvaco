Find Out<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sian Clifford has not confirmed her pregnancy, but there has been speculation about it since she appeared on her show. Her character’s sister had a miscarriage at the dinner table. One of her pals actually told her this story.</p><p>Fleabag, who is also the show’s creator, finds her sister in the restroom and then covers for her when they return to the table, allowing her sister time to recover herself despite what has just happened.</p><p>“That miscarriage is based on a true story about a friend of Phoebe’s,” she explained. She also claims that it happened at a work table rather than a meal table. This could be the reason why her supporters believe she is pregnant.</p><h2 id=sain-clifford-boyfriend-who-is-she-dating><span class=ez-toc-section id=sain-clifford-boyfriend-who-is-she-dating></span>Sain Clifford Boyfriend: Who Is She Dating?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sian Clifford has been silent about her lover.
