In September 2011, a little less than a year after Poueu proposed at the show’s ranch in Calabasas, Calif., he fell 54 feet from a friend’s roof deck and suffered multiple serious injuries. Anderson stayed by his SIDE during the grueling recovery, and they married the next summer. Then, in January 2013, they announced they were expecting their first child.</p><p>“Just from the experience of her being my caretaker post-accident, it was a dead giveaway that she’d be a fantastic mother,” Poueu told Us at the time of the pregnancy reveal. “That was an early sign for me that our child is going to have the best mother ever.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaboZecsrTAjKWmrJ2iqHq0wMSpn5qmmZp6orrDnqmsp55itKrCxKxkm6GiqbVuwM5mmZqaqWKvsMWMmp2tnaJiwKK5jKmmrp2lYsCxuMitZGtoYWh%2FdYOO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
