Joy Oladokun Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴  Line by Line Meaning ↴Ah ah ah (Mmm, mmm)
Ah ah ah (Mmm, mmm)
Ah ah ahMama says I'm up to no good again
Couldn't make her proud though I did my best
I feel like I'm a mess
I feel like I'm stuck in the wrong skin I feel like I'm sick
But I'm having trouble swallowing my medicine
Ah ah ahSunday, carry me, carry me down to the water"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The first few lines suggest that the singer is struggling to meet the expectations of her mother and is feeling inadequate despite trying her best. She feels trapped in her own skin and is struggling to accept herself. The lines "I feel like I'm sick/But I'm having trouble swallowing my medicine" may suggest that she recognizes that she needs help, but is finding it hard to accept it. These feelings of inferiority and uncertainty are further emphasized by the repetitively haunting "ah" sounds.</p><br><p>The chorus of the song draws on religious imagery, with the singer wishing to be cleansed and renewed. She yearns for the peaceful and healing experience of being by the water on a Sunday. However, instead of being uplifted by this experience, she feels crushed under the weight of societal expectations. She feels like she is being judged and is expected to be someone else, someone who meets others' expectations. The singer may be facing an internal conflict between what she truly wants and who she is expected to be, resulting in her feeling lost and burdened.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Mama says I'm up to no good again</u><br>Mama thinks I'm misbehaving once more</p><br><p><u>Couldn't make her proud though I did my best</u><br>I worked hard to impress her, but she wasn't pleased</p><br><p><u>I feel like I'm a mess</u><br>I'm emotionally disordered</p><br><p><u>I feel like I'm stuck in the wrong skin</u><br>I don't feel comfortable in my own body</p><br><p><u>I feel like I'm sick</u><br>I feel unwell</p><br><p><u>But I'm having trouble swallowing my medicine</u><br>I find it challenging to accept advice given to me</p><br><p><u>Sunday, carry me, carry me down to the water</u><br>On Sunday, I want to be taken to the water and be rejuvenated</p><br><p><u>Wash me clean</u><br>I want to be purified</p><br><p><u>I'm still struggling</u><br>I'm still having problems even after trying to overcome them</p><br><p><u>Sunday, bury me under the weight of who you need me to be</u><br>I want to be transformed to meet your expectations</p><br><p><u>Can't you see</u><br>Don't you notice my struggle?</p><br><p><u>I keep God locked in a picture frame</u><br>I only see God through a limited perspective</p><br><p><u>So I feel a little better 'bout my numbered days</u><br>I'm at peace with the fact that I'll die someday</p><br><p><u>The questions and the answers seem to sound the same</u><br>I can't distinguish between what is right and what isn't</p><br><p><u>I'm just like the rest</u><br>I'm similar to everyone else</p><br><p><u>Standing tall pretending not to be afraid</u><br>I'm trying to be brave even though I'm scared</p><br><p><u>Sunday come around, lift me up again</u><br>I need to be encouraged again on Sunday</p><br><p><u>Never too proud for a helping hand</u><br>I'm open to receiving assistance from others</p><br><p><u>I've been feeling down</u><br>I'm unhappy and depressed</p><br><p><u>Can you hear me now?</u><br>Do you understand my struggle?</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Writer(s): olubukola ayodele oladokun</span></p><p>Contributed by Ellie G.
