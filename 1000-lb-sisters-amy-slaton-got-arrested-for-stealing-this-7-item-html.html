According to reports from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sun</a>, the citation she received on June 21 of that year read that she “was stopped when an alarm went off at the exit doors.”</p><p id=par-3_41>She was then called back into the store and asked if she took anything. She told the employee that she “took a book that cost $7.57.” She was arrested and pled guilty to the crime on July 8 of that year.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-was-amy-s-punishment>What was Amy’s punishment?</h2><p id=par-4_51>For stealing the book, Amy received two years of probation, had to pay a $500 fine, and was not allowed to go into Walmart.

When I walked out the door at Walmart it beeped, the security thing,” she said, according to the outlet.</p><p id=par-7_40>“The person came over to me and was like ‘Did you steal anything?’ And I said ‘No, you can check my bag.’ He checked and was like, ‘There is a book right here, did you pay for it?’” she continued.</p><p id=par-8_31>After checking the security cameras, the employee called the police. She was then taken to the police station where she waited for two hours for her mom to pick her up.</p><p id=par-9_23>“I always learn from my mistakes and this was a big mistake… I never will do it again,” she said in the video.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-michael-halterman-has-also-been-arrested>Michael Halterman has also been arrested</h2><p id=par-10_20>Amy isn’t the only one with a record.

This season, they each have new struggles awaiting them.</p><p id=par-13_109>“Amy is dealing with her own stress, and while her dreams came true when she became a mom to son Gage, balancing the demands of motherhood with her own weight-loss goals may prove to be impossible,” the season’s summary reads. “Meanwhile, the sisters’ brother Chris had reached the goal Dr. Smith set for him to be eligible for bariatric surgery but after a setback following a procedure to remove a boil from his leg, he fears he has blown his chances for life-saving surgery. Facing another check-up with their doctor, Tammy and Chris must both face the music and see whether their progress qualifies them for weight-loss surgery. “</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGR%2BcXyPZqObZaOewLWx0axkmqWpYsCtrdOopWafn6l6or7RnqqtnZRis7C%2BjKyrnpmcnruoedOhoKxlZ2K2tbHMZ5%2BtpZxk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
