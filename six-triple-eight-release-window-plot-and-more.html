Well, that’s a pretty big time frame, and we don’t even have a trailer yet, so we’ll have to wait until that comes out first before we can get a more accurate release date.</p><h2 id=h-the-plot data-injectable=false>The plot</h2><p data-characters=622 data-current-count=975 data-injectable=true>The film will follow the true story of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, the United States’ only WAC (Women’s Army Corps) unit whose members were of women color. The 855 women were tasked with sorting through all the undelivered mail that had accumulated over the course of three years, and delivering said mail to soldiers on the front lines. All in all, there were 17 million pieces of mail to sort through and put into soldiers’ hands, and the 6888th Battalion accomplished their mission three months ahead of schedule, working under dangerous conditions, in segregated quarters, and without weapons.</p><p data-characters=489 data-current-count=489 data-injectable=true>The story of these women, and their efforts to raise the morale of soldiers far from home, hasn’t been as widely celebrated as it deserves. However, in recent years, the 6888th has seen greater recognition, having been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor by President Joe Biden in 2022. Tyler Perry, who’s known for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his work on both the big and small screen</a>, promises to shine a light on these unsung heroes, and hopefully draw even more attention to their inspirational tale.</p><h2 id=h-the-cast data-injectable=false>The cast</h2><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>The film promises a cast full of talent with Kerry Washington, known for her roles in Scandal, Ray, and Django Unchained, taking the lead in an as of yet to be named role. The rest of cast is pretty stacked, with Ebony Obsidian, Susan Sarandon, Milauna Jackson, Sam Waterston, Kylie Jefferson, Dean Norris, Shanice Shantay Sarah Jeffrey, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and even Oprah Winfrey.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsGnuMixZqyhqGLBs7XPpZxmnZmctbV50Z6jnpmjmnq4tc2dprBloKG8tXnAp5tmpZ%2BnsnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
