Beyond music <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">André has also dived headfirst into the world of Hollywood</a> starring in multiple roles in TV and movies. Even starring alongside the likes of Mark Wahlberg in the 2005 flick, Four Brothers.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>André 3000, real name André Lauren Benjamin, was born in May 1975 and began his musical career way back in 1992 forming Outkast with Big Boi shortly after graduating. The pair found success pretty quick with their first album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, going platinum in 1994.</p><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=734 data-injectable=true>The late nineties going into the early 2000s only saw the pair’s music getting more and more recognition. Arguably the peak of their mainstream popularity was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">around this time with hits like Hey Ya! And Roses</a> catapulting them all the way to the top. Whilst the two musicians did part ways eventually André has continued to develop his craft, making plenty of great solo material as well as collaborating with artists such as Beyoncé and Gorillaz.</p><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=388 data-injectable=false>As for his acting career, the musician has shown that he’s more than capable of giving a memorable performance with his most critically acclaimed role being that of Jimi Hendrix in the biopic: Jimi: All Is by My Side. Benjamin has appeared in numerous other well known Hollywood productions too, even starring alongside the likes of Mark Wahlberg in the 2005 flick, Four Brothers.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=569 data-injectable=true>As if that wasn’t enough he even started his own fashion line known as Benjamin Bixby.

Either way, we’re looking at a lot of money.</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>The musician has opened up about his struggles with anxiety and writer’s block which have slowed him down recently. However, we could have a brand new album to look forward to shortly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Killer Mike.</a> Hopefully we’re seeing the start of the Andrénaissance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZGjsbOxjGxnaWijYrumwIywpqusmGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
