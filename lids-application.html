Finding a position that allows us to earn a salary dealing with customers that share our passion is one of the best things that can happen in our life.</p><p>But, what is it like <strong>working at Lids</strong>? And how can you apply?</p><p>Well, I’m going to answer these questions with my Lids Application Online: Jobs & Career Info guide.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lids-application.png alt="lids application" width=1000 height=1500 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><span id=About_The_Company>About The Company</span></h2><p>Lids are the largest North American retailer of licensed headwear and other sports apparel. Founded in 1995 in Indianapolis, the company experienced quick and exponential growth and now operates 1100 locations in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. The majority of the stores are located in shopping malls and airports, and their primary market is still sports headwear.</p><p>However, you can also find official and branded jerseys from every professional and collegiate team, as well as other accessories and sportswear. One of the most popular services that Lids offer is to personalize your cap with customized graphics. You can even include the autograph of your favorite athlete!</p><h2><span id=What_Is_It_Like_Working_At_Lids>What Is It Like Working At Lids?</span></h2><p>It’s always nice to have a general overview of what employees think about the company you’re applying to. Thankfully, the internet is a gold mine and can help decide whether Lids is the right place for you.</p><p>Most of the reviews are extremely positive, and almost everyone is really passionate about the products that they sell. Therefore, it makes it easier for the manager to create a relaxed and fun environment where employees do their best to reach their sales targets.</p><h3><span id=In-store_Jobs>In-store Jobs</span></h3><p>Nobody likes to work in a place where your colleagues complain about how boring their job is. Luckily, this never happens at Lids! And, anyone with the right attitude can work their way up into a management role. There’s nothing worse than being stuck in a position without any opportunity for career advancement.</p><p>Lids take this issue very seriously, and the more experience you gain, the more the company will acknowledge it.</p><p>However, the biggest complaint is the relatively low pay scale. If you start working without any experience, you should expect to make around $11 per hour, which is not too bad for an entry-level position. However, the more you climb up the ladder, the less adequate your salary seems to be. A store manager makes on average just $18 per hour.</p><h2><span id=Jobs_Career_Opportunities>Jobs & Career Opportunities</span></h2><p>Whether you’re looking for a retail, distribution, or corporate position, you will find all the available vacancies on the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lids career page</a> of their official website. The list includes every job opening in the United States and Canada.</p><h3><span id=In-store_Jobs-2>In-store Jobs</span></h3><p>Your<strong> career at Lids</strong> will probably start as a part-time sales associate and eventually progress to higher positions where you might become a District Sales Manager. The requirements to apply for entry-level jobs are quite basic and do include a high school diploma, but it is not mandatory. However, great verbal communication skills, the ability to use a computer, and the capacity to stand for long hours are essential.</p><p>Your job responsibilities will mainly be to produce sales and provide excellent customer service. The job posting gives clear indications of any extra duties, but nothing is mentioned about pay, benefits, or schedule. Be aware that you will most likely be asked to be available on weekends and public holidays.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/the-lids-application-guide.png alt="the lids application guide" width=800 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><span id=Corporate_and_Distribution_Jobs>Corporate and Distribution Jobs</span></h3><p>If you still like the idea of working at Lids but are not interested in retail, you can find several alternatives in other sectors. Depending on your skills and education, there are countless opportunities, ranging from Designer to Tax Specialist, Technician, Analyst, Distribution Center Associate, and much more.</p><p>Again any details about requirements and responsibilities are given in the job listing.</p><h2><span id=How_To_Apply>How To Apply?</span></h2><p>Once you find the position you’re looking for, it’s time to click on the Apply button.</p><p>The entire application can be made by following these simple steps:</p><ul><li><i class="sui sui-hand-o-right"></i> Create an account</li><li><i class="sui sui-hand-o-right"></i> Upload your resume and cover letter</li><li><i class="sui sui-hand-o-right"></i> Provide personal information</li><li><i class="sui sui-hand-o-right"></i> Define your expected salary</li><li><i class="sui sui-hand-o-right"></i> Indicate your preferred working hours (Lids will not guarantee that your actual schedule will reflect this)</li><li><i class="sui sui-hand-o-right"></i> Respond to a few voluntary Equal Employment Opportunities questions</li></ul><p>If you have your resume and cover letter ready, it will literally take five minutes to complete the application.
