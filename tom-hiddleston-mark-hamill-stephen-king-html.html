The actors that play them are headed into a Mike Flanagan horror movie. As reported by <a href=#>Deadline</a>, Tom Hiddleston and Mark Hamill are attached to The Life of Chuck, a film based on a 2020 short story by <a href=#>Stephen King</a>.</p><p>Mike Flanagan, the man behind <a href=#>horror</a> hits like The Haunting of Hill House and Midnight Mass, will direct the film. The Life of Chuck tells Chuck Krantz’s life story in three parts, beginning with his premature <a href=#>death</a> at 39 and ending with his childhood experience in a haunted house.</p><p>The Life of Chuck is described as a horror film that draws tonal inspiration from films like Stand By Me, The Green Mile, and The Shawshank Redemption, all of which are based on Stephen King’s stories.</p><p>The project will hit the buying market this month at the Cannes International Film Festival in France. With the star power of Tom Hiddleston, Mark Hamill, Stephen King, and Mike Flanagan behind it, the project is poised to sell scary fast.</p><p>Flanagan wrote the film’s script and will produce the project for his longtime collaborator Intrepid Pictures, along with company founder Trevor Macy. FilmNation and WME are handling the sale of the film.</p><p>Tom Hiddleston is set to play the role of Chuck, with Mark Hamill taking on the role of Chuck’s grandfather, Albie. Hiddleston is set to appear in the upcoming political thriller White Stork, as well as the second season of Disney+’s Loki.</p><p>A release date for Loki has not yet been announced, but season 2 is anticipated to hit the streamer this fall. Hiddleston will be joined by returning cast members Owen Wilson and Wunmi Mosaku, as well as newcomers Eugene Cordero and Ke Huy Quan.</p><p>Before Tom Hiddleston and Mark Hamill unite, Hamill will star in plenty of other projects. 2023 will see the release of the father/son action comedy The Machine, the animated special Scoob!: Holiday Hunt, and Mike Flanagan’s The Fall of the House of Usher.</p><p>Based on Edgar Allan Poe’s short story, The Fall of the House of Usher, will join shows like The Haunting of Bly Manor and The Midnight Club as part of <a href=#>Netflix’s</a> Flanaverse.</p><p>It is not yet known where the team-up of Tom Hiddleston and Mark Hamill will land.&nbsp;Flanagan’s overall TV deal at Netflix was moved to <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Amazon data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Amazon</a> in late 2022; The Fall of the House of Usher will conclude his obligations at Netflix. Flanagan’s movies, such as Doctor Sleep, are exempt from the exclusive contract.</p><p>Tom Hiddleston and Mark Hamill will be just a few of the stars with projects looking for buyers at Cannes. FilmNation alone has projects like Paul Rudd and Amy Adams’ comedy The Invite, Andrew Garfield’s Voyagers, and Dave Bautista’s action-thriller The Cooler.</p><p>Tom Hiddleston and Mark Hamill are best known for their family-friendly franchise characters. The Life of Chuck will see the actors take a dark turn from their well-known roles, but this is not their first horror rodeo. Hiddleston also had a leading role in Guillermo del Toro’s 2015 horror film Crimson Peak, and Hamill has gotten spooky himself for Creepshow and Netflix’s The Sandman.</p><p>What the pair will do together, with a premise by Stephen King and under the direction of Mike Flanagan, is sure to be scary good.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2isn6J6qbXDnaOeq6Sku265wKuiZqCRoratuIysq56omJq7brfIp55noKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
