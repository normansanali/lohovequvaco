"So going into this album, I knew that I wanted to start with them again."</p><p>Swift also decided to bring Antonoff on board, having enjoyed her experience working with him on "Sweeter than Fiction."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Then I thought, 'Wouldn't it be amazing to work with Ryan Tedder?' And then I was with Jack Antonoff and Lena Dunham at the beach, and we started talking about our favorite ’80s music. All of this started happening organically, and I found myself gravitating toward pop sensibilities, pop hooks, pop production styles."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Taylor Swift's Record Label Went Into Panic Mode After She Switched From Country To Pop For Her 1989 Album</a></span></p><p>Swift even wrote the song "You Are In Love" about Antonoff and Dunham's relationship.</p><p>"I've never had that, so I wrote that song about things that Lena [Dunham] has told me about her and Jack [Antonoff]," <a href=#>Swift told Elle in 2015</a>. "That's just basically stuff she's told me. And I think that that kind of relationship—God, it sounds like it would just be so beautiful—would also be hard. It would also be mundane at times."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"1989" became the most successful album of Swift's career.

"His excitement and exuberance about writing songs is contagious. He’s an absolute joy. That’s why everyone loves him. I personally wouldn’t trust someone who didn’t."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Antonoff continued to work with Swift on her albums "Lover," "Folklore," and "Evermore." In 2021, he spoke to NME about Swift's professional evolution over the years.</p><p>"I’ve seen her change the music industry first-hand," Antonoff said. "She’s amazing for being a champion, and making things better for the generations to come. She has a long history of rightly exposing some real darkness in the music industry. And I’m personally thankful for it, outside of our friendship and working relationship, just as an artist. She’s asked me some questions a lot of people are afraid to ask."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2022, Swift released her "Midnights" album, which also featured contributions from Antonoff.

And sometimes she gets this look in her eye where she’s like, ‘Oh, I’m going in.’ You know, she goes in in many different ways and is just the greatest writer and vocalist ever. But on that one, I just remember watching her and being like, ‘Uh oh.
