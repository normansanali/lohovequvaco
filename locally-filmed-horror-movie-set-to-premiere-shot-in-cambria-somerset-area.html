(WJAC) — A new horror film called &#34;The Boonies&#34; was recently produced by locals...from the boonies.
Dave McMillan and Brian Balog are Westmont Hilltop grads turned independent filmmakers.
&#34;We all are familiar with the woods, or 'The Boonies.' That's part of our childhood,&#34; said Brian.
The life-long friends started producing the 97 minute horror movie in August of 2020.
&#34;The film starts off pretty innocently with some hikers going on a bachelor party weekend."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

There's also a couple that hunts, and they're going to scout a couple deer trails. From there, it gets kind of shaky," said Dave.</p><p>Dave and Brian put out an ad looking for a crew.</p><p>They found local film-making friends Matt Schultz and Lance Parkin from Ebensburg.</p><p>"It's really just one of those magic moments whenever you see what you imagined in your head and wrote taking place, and then you see the final product," said Matt.</p><p>Each scene was filmed at locations throughout Cambria and Somerset counties, including The Ridge, North Fork Dam, and Ghost Town Trail.</p><p>"It was great. It was like what I used to pretend in my head when I was like 9, but I was doing it for real, in the place I used to do it, which was cool," said Lance.</p><p>The low-budget film was even played at a West Hollywood drive-in last month in California.</p><p>"It's a difficult process without the millions of dollars that Hollywood throws at movies. So, I want them to keep that in mind if they come out," Brian said.<br></p><p>They're setting the stage for future filmmakers to stay local.</p>You don't have to run to New York City or LA. You can do it here. There's a strong community all in Western Pennsylvania.<p>"We'd like to see local talent step up and start shooting shorts, small films, and keep the ball rolling in the area," Dave said.</p><p>"The Boonies" will be available nationwide April 20th on digital and VOD platforms.<br></p><p>The movie will premiere in-person one night only at the Westwood Plaza Theatre & Cafe in Johnstown (Thursday, April 15th at 6:00pm and 8:30pm).</p><p>Go to fleeglecinemas.com or fandango.com to purchase tickets.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmpawtcKNnKamZ56axLR7y6iamqRfobykrculsGaemaG6prCMoaarqp%2Bneq671aKcZquVqXq1u4ypqZ6lmZq%2FpnnSoaatZZmjeqStzJupopldqLyusdGsnK1lkaeyog%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
