Morgan’s first film role was in&nbsp;Uncaged&nbsp;in 1991. He spent the next decade appearing as a guest star on television shows such as&nbsp;ER,&nbsp;JAG, and&nbsp;Walker, Texas Ranger. However, it was his heartbreaking role as Denny Duquette on&nbsp;Grey’s Anatomy&nbsp;from 2005 to 2006 that brought him widespread recognition.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>That same year, he also began playing John Winchester, the protagonists’ father, on&nbsp;Supernatural.
