He was born on July 2, 1989, and in 2015 and 2016, respectively, his songs "Darlin'" and "You Want Me" were hits. Both songs were awarded silver and platinum BPI certifications, with "You Want Me" reaching the charts in the UK, Belgium, and Ireland.<p>At the age of 17, Zanetti started his musical career by performing in different bars. Since then, he has grown in popularity in the music business and has worked with well-known musicians including Karen Harding, Sadie Ama, and Preditah.</p><p>Zanetti has a career in television in addition to music. In 2021, he took part in the eleventh season of the reality series "Celebs Go Dating: The Mansion." During filming of the show, Zanetti defied convention and began dating Sophie Hermann, a fellow celebrity from "Made in Chelsea." Together, the couple exited the show.</p><p>Zanetti made his debut in the sport of boxing on October 15, 2022, at the Sheffield Arena. Jack Bean, his first rival, withdrew due to mental health issues. When Jayden King, his second opponent, realized he couldn't make weight, he withdrew, and the two of them charged at the press conference. Following King's withdrawal from the fight, Zanetti was eventually taken off the fight card. Zanetti nevertheless agreed to a three-fight contract with Misfits Boxing in October 2022.</p><p>Despite his triumphs, Zanetti has encountered some controversy over the course of his career. For example, he has come under fire for using explicit language in his tracks and for engaging in a public spat with fellow DJ and producer Marvin Humes. Despite this, Zanetti has persisted in advancing his musical career and establishing a name for himself in the entertainment sector..</p><h2 class=tallist_profile_name>How to hire Tom Zanetti for an event</h2><p><b>Learn how to hire Tom Zanetti or research availability and pricing for booking Tom Zanetti to perform at a corporate event, fundraiser, private party, social media campaign, fair or festival, tradeshow or conference, endorsement project, or hire Tom Zanetti as a guest speaker, please submit the form to our agency.</b></p><h2 class=tallist_profile_name>Frequently Asked Questions about booking Tom Zanetti to perform.</h2><p>Many performers, actors, speakers and other talent like Tom Zanetti in certain cases will consider virtual appearances via live streaming.

Also, their speaking fee might be different than the fee shown for the cost to perform or to just appear. Popularity, career stage, along with current demand will cause fluctuations in their speaking price as well. The final booking price may be more than what is shown, but you should at least have a budget within that range for them to consider an appearance, performance or speaking engagement.</p><p>There is low probability to book Tom Zanetti for a party with anything substantially less than the published booking cost price range.
