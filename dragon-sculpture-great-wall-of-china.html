As they continued to dig, a tail, claws, and finally the head of a dragon emerged, as well.</p><p>Alongside the sculpture, archaeologists also unearthed a small red and black folangji, a type of cannon from Europe. It is the first of its kind ever found at the Jiankou section of the Great Wall of China.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-494478 alt=Folangji width=900 height=537 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/folangji.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-494478 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>An example of a folangji, a 14th-century European cannon.</span></p><p>Additionally, archaeologists found items used by the soldiers who lived at the tower, including tools, door rings, spoons, and shovels.</p><h2>The Historical Significance Of The Dragon Sculpture And Other Relics</h2><p>According to archaeologists, the dragon sculpture, which was known as a “kissing beast,” would have served as a decorative ornament on the roof of the watchtower. The Jiankou section of the Great Wall was constructed during the Ming Dynasty (1368 to 1644), so the dragon likely dates to the same time period.</p><p>“You can see that the scales on its body are very delicate, and the details of the mouth, eyes, nose, etc. are all carved,” archaeologist Shang Heng stated, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Archaeology News</a>. “It can be imagined that in the Ming Dynasty, the enemy tower… was very tall and magnificent, and the architectural details were also very exquisite.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-494501 alt="Great Wall Corridor" width=900 height=601 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/great-wall-corridor.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-494501 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Léonard Rodriguez / Alamy Stock Photo</span><span class=caption-body>A view from a tower along the Great Wall of China, similar to the one where archaeologists discovered the dragon sculpture.</span></p><p>“The relatively low position of this watchtower on the defense line indicated its importance in border defense,” Heng continued. “Based on the elaborate architectural components, it is preliminarily judged that the users of the watchtower were of higher rank. A junior officer might have lived here.”</p><p>After the fall of the Ming Dynasty, soldiers likely abandoned the tower, letting nature slowly reclaim it as time passed. Now, archaeologists are planning to continue excavations along the Jiankou section of the Great Wall to see what else they can uncover about China’s past.</p><p>After reading about the dragon sculpture found at the Great Wall of China, dive into the story of the <a href=#>Terracotta Army</a>, the thousands of statues created to protect China’s first emperor after death. Then, learn about the life of <a href=#>Qin Shi Huang</a>, the emperor who ordered the building of the Great Wall and the Terracotta Army.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonylvsCgpqdlo5jCrbzTrqmeZZensqLAjLCYpaRdpLNur8eipZo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
