While it‚Äôs a Celtic name which dates back centuries, you really wouldn‚Äôt want to give your transwoman a name which involves ‚Äúsir.‚Äù Second of all is the second name being Ryan, which is fairly universally a masculine name. If you‚Äôre a tad more finnicky, you may have also noticed Sirona Ryan features ‚Äúaryan‚Äù‚Ä¶ which is an unfortunate choice.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Even a game that doesn‚Äôt have JKR on writing staff is still not free from giving their minority characters horribly tasteless names.
