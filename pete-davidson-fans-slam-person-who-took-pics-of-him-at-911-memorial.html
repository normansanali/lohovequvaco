Talking to lots of people and taking pics with anyone who asked, so friendly," the source said.</p><p>They included a snap of Davidson chatting to people at the memorial.</p><p>"I hope too many people didn’t swarm him when he’s there to honor his dad," one person wrote on @deux.discussions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the source's best intentions, their post backfired. Davidson's fans, in fact, slammed taking pictures of the comedian in such a delicate circumstance.</p><p>"Not sure what’s worse, the girl for taking the picture of him and sent this in or those who went up to him and asked him for a picture. Incredibly disrespectful," one person wrote.</p><p>"This is so gross to me," was another comment.</p><p>"Of all times NOT to take a sneaky pic of a celebrity, this should be it. He's there to honor his father and be comforted and comfort those who also lost a loved one. Sometimes we just need to just put the phone away," another user noted.</p><p>One fan said the source simply should have not taken pictures of Davidson.</p><p>"This is so invasive when he’s grieving. Wrong wrong wrong. The person should not have taken a picture," they wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This 'SNL' Star Got Pete Davidson Cast On The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=finding-comfort-from-strangers-can-be-cathartic>Finding Comfort From Strangers Can Be Cathartic</h2><p>While the majority of people thought Davidson should have left alone on the day, others believe talking to strangers can be cathartic.</p><p>"I think it’s sweet," one person wrote.</p><p>"Finding comfort from strangers who know & love u can be cathartic. If he didn’t want to be bothered he wouldn’t have gone. Pete lives an isolating life & this might be nice for him to get love & support from people who love him. He looks happy, too," they added.</p><p>"Last night at the comedy show at MSG he said that he was tired of being sad on 9/11. He wanted a celebration!" another person wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Davidson has his dad's badge number tattooed on his left arm.
