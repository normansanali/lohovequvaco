Founded in the autumn of 1889, Nintendo Playing Card Co. was the opportunistic endeavor of Fusajiro Yamauchi, who capitalized on a lifted ban on playing cards. Foreign card games had long been banned by the Japanese empire as subliminal Western imperialism, but an exception was made for a regional picture deck called hanafuda, or “flower cards."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Foreign card games had long been banned by the Japanese empire as subliminal Western imperialism, but an exception was made for a regional picture deck called hanafuda, or “flower cards.”</p><p>People were initially wary of their mercurial government’s tendency to reverse course, but soon the Yakuza began running hanafuda gambling rings and the game took off. Yamauchi saw an opportunity in the illegal market, and thus named this company 任天堂 (Nin-Ten-Do), an ambiguous word containing Yakuza codes signaling their use for gambling.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-10656 alt="Nintendo History Hanafuda Poster" width=800 height=552 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/nintendo-history-hanafuda-poster.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-10656 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>Wikipedia</a></p><p>Yamauchi never fathered a son, and so in 1929 passed on his factory to his son-in-law, Sekiryo Kaneda, who would then take the Yamauchi name. The card company would weather the Second World War and be passed on to another son-in-law, who would pass it on to his son, Hiroshi, in 1949.</p><p>Nintendo dominated the playing card market under the leadership of Hiroshi Yamauchi, printing adult playing decks for US soldiers and securing the rights to print Disney characters in 1959. But as the technological advances of the day began to invade more aspects of daily life, parlor games lost their popularity with the general public and Nintendo was faced with finding a new product to sell.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-10661 alt="Nintendo's History Pinup Deck" width=800 height=466 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/nintendo-history-pin-up-deck.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-10661 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>Wikipedia</a></p><p>By 1963, the Nintendo Playing Card Co. would become Nintendo Company Ltd and enter any market available, be it a taxi service, a copy machine or even a short-stay “love hotel,” a clandestine destination often frequented by the married Yamauchi.</p><p>Each venture failed, putting the company on the verge of bankruptcy. On a tour of his failing printing press, Yamauchi found his solution in maintenance man Gunpei Yokoi. Struck by the extendable arm Yokoi had built for personal amusement, Yamauchi ordered the mass production of Yokoi’s toy and it saw instant success. Thanks to that chance encounter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo was reborn as a toy company</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyptdKtpquxXaSzbrrIp6ueppSk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
