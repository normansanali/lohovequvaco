I go to work, go home to my apartment and sleep. I was exceptionally grumpy that day, because not only had i been soaked due to the rain, id also lost my phone. So i got home, hit the kettle to make a coffee, and slumped in a chair, before flicking through the TV, knowing full-well that nothing would interest me. I heard a crackling.. sort of a fizzing noise, coming from my bedroom..So i went to look.</p><p>I couldnt beleive my eyes, it was as if something was being suspended in mid air! A sort of purple cloud.. Like a mini-lightening storm...I rubbed my eyes, and the cloud got bigger and bigger... I swore to myself, "What the F#@£ is going on?!"... Thats when i got a reply, not a standard one however. It was in an echoey, kinda distant tone "Mind your tongue boy! Pack a bag and walk through the gate" I stumbled back, shocked.. i swore again, unintentionally.</p><p>Now what happened next, no-one will beleive, you'll think its mad, that this is a story.. and thats fine.</p><p>Within a second, a man stepped through the cloud, wearing a purple suit... He was a rather elderly man, maybe late 50's, but he walked like he was in his teens. "Who the hell are you? What the hell is that? But... Thats.." I stuttered, awestruck. "Pack a bag. Ill explain on the way.." I was about to argue back, when he pushed me into a wall, "Your hesitation will get us ALL killed, DO IT!" So i did. Not having to worry about family, i was abandoned, so i lived alone. We both stepped through the cloud... (When i say we both stepped, I got pushed while he walked through)</p><p>That was the day my world turned upside down, and my dreams became my nightmares...</p><p>Name: Reece</p><p>Age: 19</p><p>Powers: Unknown</p><p>Personality: Reece had learned that no one was going to look out for him, so he had to do it himself. He would do what he can to ensure that he came out on top. He didnt care. He was untrusting of most people, and only looked out for those he considered to be friends, which didnt come easily... he had a fiery temper, and got carried away a lot. Although he didnt look strong, his mentality compensated for it. He kept pushing and Pushing 'till he won.</p><p>Appearance: <a href=#>View attachment 69267</a><br>(Picture made using Hero machine 3)</p><p>From: London</p><p>There we go, just a simple SU will do, since we will find out about each other during the RP...</p><p>ENJOY <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bulbagarden.net/data:image/gif;base64 alt=:D title="Big Grin :D" data-shortname=:D style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHylrdGrnKdlo52ur3nDnqSoppGprm6%2Bz2aqop%2BeYsKxv4yop56mXWZ%2Fb32Sb2txbV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
