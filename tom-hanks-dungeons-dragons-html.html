Jaffe based his novel on inaccurate newspaper stories about Egbert’s disappearance, which blamed <a href=#>Dungeons & Dragons</a> for his actions. But it was later revealed that personal issues unrelated to the game were the primary reasons for what transpired.</p><p>James Egbert III was a brilliant young man with a troubled personal life. He had experienced difficulties adjusting socially and had faced bullying in his earlier years. He turned to fantasy role-playing games, particularly Dungeons & Dragons, which he played with friends and local gamers as a means of escape and expression.</p><p>In 1979, during a break from college, Egbert went missing. His disappearance was initially linked to his interest in D&D, and rumors circulated that he had become so immersed in the game that he had lost touch with reality. It was speculated that he was attempting to live out a real-life version of the game, including hiding in steam tunnels beneath the university’s campus, just like the Tom Hanks movie.</p><p>The media attention and sensationalized coverage of the case led to a moral panic surrounding D&D and other role-playing games. The portrayal of the game as dangerous (as seen in the Tom Hanks movie) created a distorted image of the hobby and its enthusiasts. Investigations into Egbert’s disappearance were complex and involved multiple agencies, including private investigators hired by his family.</p><p>The case also took a toll on Egbert’s parents, who struggled to cope with the uncertainty surrounding their son’s disappearance. In reality, Egbert’s disappearance had little to do with his interest in Dungeons & Dragons. After an extensive search, it was discovered that Egbert had left MSU voluntarily to visit several cities, staying with various people he had met along the way.</p><p><strong>The portrayal of Dungeons & Dragons as dangerous (as seen in the Tom Hanks movie) created a distorted image of the hobby and its enthusiasts.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mazes-and-monsters-still-tom-hanks-900x506.jpg><p>Unlike the Tom Hanks movie, with its questionable ending, Egbert was found in Morgan City, Louisiana, staying with a private investigator named William Dear, who had been hired to find him. Egbert was dealing with personal issues and academic pressure, which had led him to run away and seek refuge outside of Michigan.</p><p>His connection to role-playing games was a small part of the broader picture. As more accurate information about Egbert’s disappearance became known, the link between the case and D&D was debunked. James Dallas Egbert III returned to Michigan and resumed his studies, but he tragically died by suicide in 1980, less than a year after his initial disappearance.</p><p>In retrospect, the case of James Dallas Egbert III serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of sensationalized media coverage, the complexities of mental health struggles, and the need for understanding and support for individuals facing personal challenges. Unfortunately, the Tom Hanks movie saw this tragedy as an opportunity to make a quick buck.</p><p>Mazes and Monsters,&nbsp;starring Tom Hanks, is currently streaming on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peacock</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2isn6J6qa3NpKpmnKWjtKa7zaxknaqRnLyvv42hq6ak</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
