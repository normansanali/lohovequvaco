Starting in 2009, he took four years <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>to just focus on his art</a>. "A lot of big canvases, a lot of paint, a lot of texture. It's all based on emotion and a streamline of consciousness," he told StarCam in 2012.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>In an interview with Vulture in 2011, Grieco said, "<span>I always <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>considered myself a painter</a>. It is cathartic for me to see people and what they get from the piece; it's so rewarding to see them cry and how it's changed their life. It makes me feel amazing."</span></p><p>Grieco has recorded several songs over the years. He released his first album, Waiting for the Sky to Fall, in 1995, and as recently as 2020, he put out a new song, "Six Feet Away," which his website notes<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#> he wrote while in lockdown</a> during the COVID-19 pandemic. He also took part in season 3 of Gone Country, a reality show in which musicians who work in other genres compete in becoming a country singer.</p><p>Grieco has a son, <strong>Dylan Grieco</strong>, who is in his early 20s. The actor welcomed Dylan with his ex, <strong>Kimber Sissons</strong>, who, like Grieco, was a model. Now, Dylan is following in their footsteps. He told The Daily Front Row in 2019 that <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>his mom convinced him</a> to give modeling a go.</p><p>"<span>She used to model and so did my dad. She said it was a good way to make money,&nbsp; meet a bunch of people, and it's a great way to travel," he said. He also shared that he's closer to his mom than his dad: "My dad wasn't really in the picture. My mom and I are like best friends. It's just been her and I my whole life. We're very close."</span></p><p>Grieco shares a bit about her personal life on his Instagram account, including <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>photos with his current partner</a>, <strong>Michelle</strong>.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>See Former Teen Idol Ally Sheedy Now at 59</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZma2ldn8KuvIysq6udlal6s7XCoZirnF2cv6qxwqhkp6enYrumw9Jo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
