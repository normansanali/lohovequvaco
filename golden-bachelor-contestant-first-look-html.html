But as with any season of The Bachelor, we’re not really watching for the Bach himself; we’re here to watch the interpersonal dynamics of a huge cast of women, forced into a dating-scarcity microeconomy and living in a big house together. And by far the most exciting element of The Golden Bachelor is its cast of ladies 60 and up, which was revealed today in a <a href=#>People exclusive</a>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clly4geab001e3j804zvk5hp4@published data-word-count=99>The Golden Bachelor girls are a far cry from The Golden Girls; for one, there are 22 of them, which amounts to a 550 percent Golden Girl inflation. Also, they’re all mother in a very 2023 way, positively brimming with attitude, quirk, and cosmetological work. In a promotional video also released today, six of the women mentioned that they love pickleball, a hobby that Turner also mentioned in his Bach reveal. Leading with such a glaring red flag? Bold. Pickleball is a boomer epidemic! The Golden Bachelor premieres September 28 on ABC. Until then, meet all 22 contestants below.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clly4swvg00243j80ks1xse00@published data-word-count=20><strong>Theresa, 69</strong><br>She’s a financial-services professional from New Jersey who says she “loves ’70s rock, both soft and hard.” Okayyyyy, naughty!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clly4uqa9002b3j8048h86ar0@published data-word-count=22><strong>Sylvia, 64</strong><br>This L.A. public-affairs consultant “loves any excuse to put on a costume” and “enjoys lifting small weights.” She’s going for relatable.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clly4wrjv002i3j80hwi5ihuh@published data-word-count=34><strong>Susan, 66</strong><br>She’s a wedding officiant from Pennsylvania, which … does that mean she got ordained once for a friend’s wedding? She’s the one who looks like a Kris Jenner impersonator, and apparently it’s intentional.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clly4z0kp002p3j80zp98cq8w@published data-word-count=78><strong>Sandra, 75</strong><br>Does not look a day over 60. Every fact about this Georgia retiree is gold: Luther Vandross puts her “in the mood,” she is “very proud of her high credit score,” and she refuses to pick a favorite NFL team because she loves them all, which is honestly very adorable, like someone going to a game with a hat on that just says FOOTBALL. Or she just said that to hedge her bets with all possible Bachelors.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clly52095002w3j80figjrtvp@published data-word-count=17><strong>Renee, 67</strong><br>A former Honey Bear cheerleader for the Chicago Bears, Renee “really wants to meet Harry Styles.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clly52vva00333j80fdk8z61m@published data-word-count=31><strong>Peggy, 69</strong><br>This dental hygienist from Connecticut would have a “very cute bichon frise named Libby.” Hopefully she lasts long enough to share her love of go-karting with Gerry on a date.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clly5470v003a3j804dhv0rhx@published data-word-count=28><strong>Patty, 70</strong><br>Literally Matt James’s mom. She “loves her body glitter and encourages you to do the same,” and don’t even talk to her before she’s had her java.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clly553le003h3j803f6j2maf@published data-word-count=31><strong>Pamela, 75</strong><br>I think if I were brave enough to use the TikTok age filter, my best-case scenario would be looking like Pamela, who “can’t get enough Judge Judy in her life.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clly56cdi003o3j80go9249im@published data-word-count=30><strong>Natascha, 60</strong><br>This NYC native wants bell-bottoms to make a comeback (wait it out — they will) and is a “pro-aging coach and midlife speaker,” which … what does that mean?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clly59j2z003v3j8020fekd0i@published data-word-count=36><strong>Nancy, 60</strong><br>Nancy is sort of like the factory default setting of someone who would be a contestant on The Golden Bachelor: She dances at weddings, likes rom-coms, and is a retired interior designer from Alexandria, Virginia.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clly5ax8q00423j805ii9v9qu@published data-word-count=58><strong>Marina, 60</strong><br>Not going to lie — Marina is probably my favorite so far. She just seems like she’s up to something. The promo included the crew off set laughing at her joke about bringing her pickleball gear to the Bachelor mansion, she does not stand in lines, and she has “not one, not two, but THREE master’s degrees.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clly5co8o00493j80einwjv54@published data-word-count=51><strong>Maria, 60</strong><br>One of Maria’s three facts about herself is that she has “never gone paintballing but really wants to try,” which is very impressive because she’s from New Jersey and it seems like it’s impossible not to be hit with a paintball at some point if you live in New Jersey.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clly5f5z9004g3j80iur5hfb4@published data-word-count=35><strong>Leslie, 64</strong><br>This fitness instructor from Minneapolis hates mice, as opposed to all those people who love mice, and her favorite concerts ever were Lady Gaga and Post Malone.
