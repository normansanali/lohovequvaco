Malik revealed that he has written songs about people in his life, but has learned not to tell them about it.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#LetMe</a>.

It just complicates things, so I have tended not to do that anymore. I just keep it to myself,” he said, adding that he’s told someone in the past and it was a bit “embarrassing” for him. “I’ll be having a conversation with somebody, maybe a little argument with them, and then [I’ll] throw it in their face: ‘Well, I wrote that song about you so see you later.'”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The singer also revealed that even though he misses “the food and the accents, the banter,” he has no plans of moving back to England and will be living in Los Angeles after his split from his girlfriend of two years, <strong><a href=#>Gigi Hadid</a></strong>. The <a href=#>pair called it quits</a> in March.</p><p>“Gigi and I had an incredibly meaningful, loving and fun relationship and I have a huge amount of respect and adoration for Gigi as a woman and a friend,” he <a href=#>wrote in a statement</a> on Twitter at the time. “She has such an incredible soul. I’m grateful to all of our fans for respecting this difficult decision and our privacy at this time, we wish this news could have come from us first. We love you all. xZ.”</p><p>Since then, Malik has been teasing the arrival of his new music and even deleted all of this posts on his <a href=#>Instagram account</a> before he began promoting “Let Me.” Although he hasn’t announced the title or the release date yet, the singer is gearing up to release his second album this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaLGasZ5iuqK4yKRkq52cmq60sdJmo56sXaKybsLInZyoZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
