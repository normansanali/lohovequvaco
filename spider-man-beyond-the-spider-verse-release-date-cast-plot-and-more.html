If our math is right, then that means we only have a 10-month wait between the films, provided there’s no change to the schedule. It’s such a short wait as both of the films were worked on concurrently.</p><h2 id=h-cast data-injectable=false>Cast</h2><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true>Whilst most of the cast have yet to be confirmed for the threequel, we do know that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shameik Moore</a> will be returning as Miles Morales (duh) and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Schwartzman</a> has been confirmed to return as The Spot. The plot looks to carry on directly from Across the Spider-Verse, so we can expect to see many of the same heroes and villains and expect the same voice cast to return.</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false>Voices who have been a part of the universe from the start will more than likely be back for the final part, including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hailee Steinfeld</a> as Gwen, Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker and Luna Lauren Vélez and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brian Tyree Henry</a> as Miles as Miles’ mother and Father. Expect to hear <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oscar Isaac</a>, Great Lee, Issa Rae and Daniel Kaluuya returning too.</p><h2 id=h-the-director-and-writers data-injectable=false>The Director and Writers</h2><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true>Aside from the cast, the same team behind the making of the latest installment will also be back with Across the Spider-Verse director Joaquim Dos Santos helming the sequel. Phil Lord and Chris Miller are back to write the screenplay as well.</p><h2 id=h-the-story data-injectable=false>The Story</h2><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>The third film will conclude the story that started in Across the Spider-Verse. Whilst it was originally all supposed to be one film, the decision was made later on to split them into two full-length films creating a two-part story. Beyond the Spider-Verse will look to resolve the conflicts set up in its predecessor, but we can expect to see more of Miles’ struggles, more of the Spider Society and most importantly, more of The Spot.</p><h2 id=h-what-will-the-age-rating-be data-injectable=false>What will the age rating be?</h2><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=233 data-injectable=false>At the time of writing, the upcoming movie has no age rating, as it’s a little too early to expect one just yet. However, the previous two films both have PG ratings, so there’s no reason to suspect this film to be any different.</p><h2 id=h-will-this-be-the-last-spider-verse-film data-injectable=false>Will this be the last Spider-Verse film?</h2><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=629 data-injectable=false>Whilst this may round off this particular chapter of Miles’ life, we can certainly expect to see more animated movies taking place within the same universe, or multiverse. The Spider society opens up so many possibilities for different animated Spider-Man projects. There is already supposed to be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a female-led spin-off in the works</a>, so we know we’ll be seeing some of these characters again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqqmhlJq%2FbrnAp2Sbnamku6V506GcZqugnrGmvoyvnKurlWK%2FprjEmqqeZZSWwaZ5wpqqrWWgoby1ecCnm2aln6eycA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
