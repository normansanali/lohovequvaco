I love you.”</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to see the couple’s PDA-filled romance:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwLWxz6Gcp2WTqr%2BzxYyasJ6rmJZ6pMHRq7CsZZikwbWx0q1kpqedmru1v4ypn6isn6h8pLvVnqlmn5mnuW64zq%2BcaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
