However, they <a href=#>called off their engagement</a> one month later. Sources told Us Weekly at the time that Brown’s family members didn’t approve of the relationship. (Prior to her February 2012 death, Houston informally adopted Gordon when he was 12 years old; he lived with the family throughout his teens.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In July 2013, Brown announced that their engagement was back on and <a href=#>clarified the nature of their relationship</a>. “Yes, me and Nick are engaged. I’m tired of hearing people say, ‘Eww you’re engaged to your brother’ or ‘If Whitney was still alive, would we be together or would she approve of this?'” she wrote on Facebook. “Let me clear up something, we aren’t even real brother and sister, nor is he my adoptive brother. My mom never adopted him. In fact, mommy was the one who even said that she knew that we were going to start dating.”</p><p>In addition to her marriage announcement, Brown also hinted on Twitter Thursday that she’ll be sharing other news soon. “BIGGGG things in store guys . . . I’m so excited!” she wrote. “We bouta change the world babbbbby! #bringEmOut! #Getready! xO!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabp5KXtm630aKqraGelnqjvs6wpWaZnpl6r7XCpGSgp6KZvK95x5qnqaGcrnqurdGroJ6cXaiypnnToZyiql2ssqWwyKeeZqqZo7S0eZFpaG1pYGZ8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
