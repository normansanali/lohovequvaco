It’s not my job to teach them that. … I thought it was illegal, honestly, to shame a child or shame a mom for what a child wears … in 2018.”</p><p>As for Silverstone, the Clueless star revealed in September 2020 that her and ex-husband <strong>Christopher Jarecki</strong>’s son, Bear, was bullied for his long hair.</p><p>“One time <a href=#>my son was made fun of</a> by other kids because of his hair on a bus ride to surf camp,” the actress explained via Instagram at the time. “After he had returned and told me, I thought he would want to cut it for a haircut appointment we had already scheduled the next day, but when we showed up, he said, ‘Please give me a trim so I can grow it to my waist.’ That’s my boy!
