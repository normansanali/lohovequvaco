Efron — who is an older brother to Dylan, Olivia and Henry — has recalled how his siblings and parents supported him throughout his career.
“My family’s my rock. I know that they’re not going anywhere. More and more I rely on my little brother to keep me grounded,” he shared during a 2013 interview."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I know that they’re not going anywhere. More and more I rely on my little brother to keep me grounded,” he shared during a 2013 interview. “I know my family’s always going to be there, and then there’s also some times when life changes, they can’t always be there for you in the way that you need, so I rely on my friends.”</p><p>Years later, Efron revealed the important life lessons that he learned from his family.</p><p>“My parents love me in very different ways. But they checked every box. My dad always taught me to be driven,” he told Elle in 2016. “I was always the shortest kid at school. Always the worst kid on the team. I’d come home after practice and my dad would build a basketball hoop. Then we’d go out and shoot 100 free throws. Pretty soon every time I got fouled I would make my free throws.”</p><p>While he loves his own family — and is a great older brother — Efron admitted he’s not quite ready to have children of his own.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I have a healthy respect for parents, very grateful for them all,” he said during a May 2022 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. “I love you so much, Mom.”</p><p>Scroll down for the sweetest photos of Efron and his family over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkx6KvjJ6dq6eeqHq0w8Seq56rpGKzornIpbBmqJikwbC%2FjLCgraBdnba0edKimaWhnpzAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
