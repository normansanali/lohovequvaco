This has been going on for five years. And he doesn’t leave her alone; he keeps coming back,” she went on. “I wouldn’t let him see the kids if it was me.

The news broke shortly after Britney’s divorce from Sam Asghari was finalized; some reports claim Britney cheated on Sam with Paul when he was under her employment, though it hasn’t been confirmed.</p><p>Britney has since slammed paramedics for invading her privacy, claiming she merely injured her ankle in an accidental fall, denying allegations of a fight. She did, however, place the <a href=#>blame on her mom, Lynne Spears, for the ordeal</a>, though Lynne didn’t seem to be present at the time of the fight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq6Gko7K6edKpnJqqo2KvsMXFq6CeppSoeqbEjKCgq6SWp7amusNmm56ZlJeyosCMnZidZZ6kwW6twqSlqK%2BcmrGotc2gZGpoXaC2pb%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
